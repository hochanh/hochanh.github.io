## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 18-7-2007(25): Maybe the Japanese ought to rethink their nickname for America. Seriously, the only &quot;<em>rice</em>&quot; I have seen in the <em>wild west</em> is<strong> foxtail millet</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 29-5-2008(10): West, rice: In the <em>old west</em> there was a special type of plant (it&#039;s now extinct): the<strong> foxtail millet</strong>. It behaved like regular millet, but when somebody wanted to reap it, it ran away as quick as a fox, leaving a small trail of <em>rice</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 10-3-2010(5): Davy Crockett&#039;s foxtail hat, symbol of the <em>Old West</em> &amp; early 米国 spirit, was not as popularly believed made from the tail of an actual fox. Faux fox,<strong> foxtail millet</strong> weave. Still, no one would deny its importance as the prototype of the modern <strong>foxtail mullet</strong> so much admired in the bowling alleys of Honolulu.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 28-7-2009(3): In the <em>Old West</em>,<strong> foxtail millet</strong> was eaten like <em>rice</em>.
