## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 14-1-2007(36): I threw my <em>dart</em> at a<strong> pheasant</strong> during the hunt, but hit a <em>turkey</em> instead.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum">oregum</a>] 14-1-2009(5): A<strong> pheasant</strong> is like a small wild TURKEY except you can kill it with a DART.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869">perrin4869</a>] 22-5-2011(4): I tried to kill the <em>turkey</em> with a <em>dart</em>, but a <strong>pheasant</strong>, who was his good friend, jumped in between to save the turkey.<strong> Pheasant</strong> turned out to be just as good though.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 23-1-2010(3): I had the<strong> pheasant</strong> clearly in view when I threw the <em>dart</em> but wouldn&#039;t you know it at precisely the wrong moment a <em>turkey</em> ran between us &amp; became the 7th one down in RtK3.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django">Django</a>] 30-12-2009(2): <em>Cupid</em> may be the god of love, but he&#039;s also one rather spoilt child. We brought him a <em>turkey</em> for dinner the other day, and he just sulked, saying he&#039;d only have<strong> pheasant</strong>. What an ungrateful deity!!
