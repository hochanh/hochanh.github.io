## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 30-12-2008(22): My <em>wife</em> wanted a special place to<strong> roost</strong>, so I built her one - on the top of that <em>tree</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 4-12-2008(18): Better meaning is &quot;habitat&quot; since this doesn&#039;t imply anything bird or nest related. Usual habitat for the wife is in a wood structure of some sort (avoiding using house to keep it out of the kanji).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 24-9-2006(11): His <em>wife</em> wanted the chickens in the hen house to be housed properly, so she chopped up a <em>tree</em> and made wooden<strong> roost</strong>s for them to sit on.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Machine_Gun_Cat">Machine_Gun_Cat</a>] 29-7-2009(7): If my wifes being a bitch I go and<strong> roost</strong> in a tree.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(2): A frustrated <em>wife</em> makes the <em>tree</em> her<strong> roost</strong>.
