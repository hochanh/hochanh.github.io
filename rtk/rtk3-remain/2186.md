## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 16-12-2009(33): A<strong> DUGOUT</strong> is a dry moat found around Japanese castles. The SOIL is arranged so as to OVERPOWER (or give the advantage to OVERPOWER) an attacking army. If dug in a low lying area it fills with water and becomes a moat ( 濠 <a href="../v4/2306.html">moat</a> (#2306 濠)).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 15-4-2008(14): As they constructed the visiting team <strong>dugout</strong>, they removed a quantity of <em>soil</em> when there was an <em>overpowering</em> stench. Nobody will want to use this <strong>dugout</strong>!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 18-5-2009(10): Too scared to go up to bat, one of the players <em>soils</em> himself in the<strong> dugout</strong>. The smell is so <em>overpowering</em>, the other players have to step out for air.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 7-11-2008(10): We needed to create a<strong> dugout</strong> in the <em>soil</em> in order to avoid the <em>overpowering</em> attacks coming from the sky.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 8-8-2009(5): Hiding in a<strong> dugout</strong>, below the <em>soil</em> is the once <em>overpowering</em> Sadam Hussein.
