## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 29-6-2007(50): <strong>Flea</strong>s jump onto your <em>crotch</em>, take <em>two drops</em> of blood, and then go on their merry way: what vile <em>insects</em>!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 20-12-2009(3): <strong>Flea</strong>! One bite in the middle of my <em>crotch</em> another just to the left &amp; I can still feel the <em>insect</em> itself crawling around down there.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 7-1-2007(3): Right side of <a href="../v4/1985.html">boisterous</a> (#1985 騒) (but without the drops there). A<strong> flea</strong> is an insect that is depicted here as jumping from (or to) a crotch (the two drops). Note: this is indeed<strong> flea</strong>, not louse, which has its own character (虱). I&#039;m not sure of the stroke order, but by the rule of drawing from top to bottom, the crotch drop should come first. The louse (虱) then is of course a drop-like insect that attaches itself to body hairs by little hooks.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 19-3-2011(): Those <em>two little marks</em> you saw after scratching your <em>crotch</em> might be because of that dreaded <em>insect</em>, the<strong> flea</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 13-1-2011(): A mama<strong> flea</strong>(<em>insect</em>) teaching her two kids(the <em>drops</em>) how to suck blood from the crotch region.
