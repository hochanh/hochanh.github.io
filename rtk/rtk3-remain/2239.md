## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(40): With few visitors, the<strong> tomb sanctuary</strong> in the <em>cave</em> is only open in the <em>morning</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 27-4-2007(22): The<strong> tomb sanctuary</strong> of the Egyptian pharaohs is only open in the <em>morning</em>. At night they seal the <em>cave</em> to keep the spirits from escaping!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Green_Airplane">Green_Airplane</a>] 15-3-2010(8): Come <em>morning</em>, vampires must seek sanctuary. Of course, <strong>tomb sanctuary</strong> would be ideal, but any <em>cave</em> will do.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 22-10-2009(3): Perhaps a better keyword, practically synonymous with<strong> tomb sanctuary</strong>, would have been <strong>crypt</strong> (since mausoleum has already been used). The <strong>crypt</strong> at Canterbury Cathedral is the largest <strong>crypt</strong> in England. Its <em>cave</em>-like interior is unfortunately only open in the <em>morning</em>, however, so make sure you head down early!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 13-8-2009(2): The<strong> tomb sanctuary</strong> is in a bat <em>cave</em>. People are only allowed to visit in the <em>morning</em>, because of the vampires.
