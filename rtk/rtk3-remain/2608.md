## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 29-1-2007(24): <strong>Crabgrass</strong> is <em>lowly</em> wild grass, quickly spreading with nasty roots, and difficult to remove out of your <em>wheat</em> field.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/At0m5k">At0m5k</a>] 18-8-2009(7): <strong>Japanese barnyard millet</strong> (Echinochloa utilis). In Japan&#039;s past, this type of millet was grown where conditions were not suitable for rice paddies. It was far more common than <em>wheat</em> and helped to alleviate starvation when rice was damaged by cold weather. However since then it has become quite a <em>lowly</em> grain and is only grown in northern Iwate-ken.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 18-1-2009(7): A <em>lowly wheat</em> field only grows <strong>crap grass</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 7-9-2009(3): <strong>Crabgrass</strong> (<strong>Japanese millet</strong>) is a <em>lowly</em> grain, not unlike <em>wheat</em> in flavour, but so <em>lowly</em> that you have to get right down on the ground to find the crabs in it.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 30-10-2010(2): 稗 , 稗史 , 稗麺 <a href="../v4/2608.html">crabgrass</a> (#2608 稗) ハイ, ひえ ... Parts: 禾, 卑 ... Note: Spahn - 5d8.2. Comes with either version of lowly depending on the font. ... Story: Not actually<strong> crabgrass</strong>, but the keyword millet was taken and it had lowly as an element, so <em>Lowly</em> crappy <em>Wheat</em>, that tastes bad and yields low =<strong> Crabgrass</strong>. ... cf: Lowly Ver. 1: 卑しい <a href="../v4/1511.html">lowly</a> (#1511 卑), 歌碑 <a href="../v4/1512.html">tombstone</a> (#1512 碑), 稗 <a href="../v4/2608.html">crabgrass</a> (#2608 稗), 金牌 <a href="../v4/2873.html">mahjong tiles</a> (#2873 牌).
