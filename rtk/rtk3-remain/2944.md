## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 22-4-2007(31): If you<strong> snore</strong>, your <em>nose</em> becomes <em>dry</em>. I try to remember the slightly different bottom part by wanting to hit the snoring nose with two hands but can&#039;t quite reach. KUN yomi reading いびき.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 18-3-2010(6): If you cannot breathe through your <em>nose</em>, your airways become <em>dry</em> and you<strong> snore</strong>. Note: To remember 丌 - An old snoring cure was to stuff a pie (mathematical π) into subject&#039;s mouth. Because so many choked this cure fell out of favour.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 7-3-2011(3): People<strong> snore</strong> when a combination of two elements occur; 1. their<em> nose</em> is deformed (the strange two arms) and 2. their nose is <em>dry</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 2-8-2009(2): Stay <em>dry</em> (from alcohol) and wear a <em>nose plug</em> if you tend to<strong> snore</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 24-5-2009(2): My girlfried has a sweet <em>SNUB-NOSE</em> (to remember the short strokes) but she<strong> snore</strong>s amazingly strong...! She sucks the air into her nose until everything in the flat is <em>DRY</em>. She is like a hoover!
