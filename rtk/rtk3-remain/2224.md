## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 18-11-2007(30): <strong>High-reaching</strong> aspirations usually revolve around the <em>mountain</em> that is the <em>tallest</em>. For climbing, for descending, for just bring there - the thrill of it all.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 20-11-2008(12): People like Sir Edmund Hillary set very<strong> high-reaching</strong> goals, like being the first to climb Everest, the <em>tallest</em> <em>mountain</em> in the world.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 14-10-2008(10): A <em>mountain</em> that&#039;s <em>tall</em> is also<strong> high-reaching</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 5-7-2010(5): A<strong> high-reaching</strong> <em>mountain</em> is obviously <em>tall</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 17-2-2010(5): This means<strong> high-reaching</strong>, as in a pile almost reaching a <em>mountain</em> in height/<em>tallness</em>. More of a physical image rather than the metaphorical one.
