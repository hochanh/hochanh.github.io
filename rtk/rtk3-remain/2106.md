## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 16-2-2008(28): Mr. T was selected to head up the committee studying the<strong> Yamato</strong> period.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 13-10-2007(21): There&#039;s always a <em>person</em> named<strong> Yamato</strong> on every <em>committee</em>. And I always hate them.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 14-7-2009(12): This kanji was originally used as the Chinese word for Japan, and its etymological meaning is that of a &quot;supplicating people&quot;. In the 8th century the use of this kanji to describe Japan (read as &quot;Wa&quot; or &quot;Yamato&quot;) was changed to the kanji for <a href="../v4/897.html">harmony</a> (#897 和), which was popular because the Japanese liked to believe that their society was based on harmony (not on being submissive and dominable as this kanji suggests). Story: <em>Dad</em> joined the<strong> Yamato</strong> <em>committee</em> to foster international cooperation.
