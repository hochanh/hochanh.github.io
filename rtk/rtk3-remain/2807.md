## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 17-7-2007(33): The guy who said that you can take a <em>horse</em> to a <em>river</em>, but you can&#039;t make it drink obviously has never encountered a<strong> tame</strong> <em>horse</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 14-8-2008(13): The process to getting a<strong> tame</strong> horse is a bit like getting a<strong> tame</strong> Christian - baptizization! you take it into the <em>river</em> at a young age (just after it&#039;s born is best) and dunk it in until it is almost drowned. Then at the last possible moment, when its life is flashing before its eyes (good baptizers know when this is), you pull it back above water. The first thing it sees is its &quot;rescuer&quot; and &quot;savior&quot;, and it will be<strong> tame</strong> and follow you for the rest of its life.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 13-1-2010(6): <em>Horse</em>, <em>stream</em>. You can lead a<strong> tame</strong> <em>horse</em> to <em>water</em> &amp; also make it drink.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paasan">paasan</a>] 28-7-2010(4): (+Megaqwerty) The <em>Trojan Horse</em> was so well-behaved the Troys took it for being <strong>tame</strong>. They even took it to the <em>stream</em> to drink. (Think of the Troys playing with the horse like little girls play with dolls). It didn&#039;t drink of course, and that&#039;s where the proverb &#039;you can take a horse to a river, but you cannot make it drink&#039; comes from.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brendanmacdonald">brendanmacdonald</a>] 23-10-2008(2): Can you<strong> TAME</strong> this wild HORSE to cross this RIVER?
