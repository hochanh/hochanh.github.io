## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 5-2-2008(32): The 惰 <a href="../v4/629.html">lazy</a> (#629 惰) way to draw an<strong> ellipse</strong> requires two <em>wooden</em> pegs and some string (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/252zgx">http://tinyurl.com/252zgx</a>).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cb4960">cb4960</a>] 17-3-2009(15): When tasked with planting the <em>trees</em> to form a circle, the somewhat <em>lazy</em> gardener just winged it (instead of measuring) and the result was an <strong>ellipse</strong> of trees.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 1-1-2009(6): (re: Johnzep&#039;s story for <em>lazy</em>) When I went under a <em>tree</em> to beat my <em>meat</em> with my <em>left</em> hand, my motions formed the shape of an<strong> ellipse</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 27-7-2009(3): A <em>lazy</em> <em>tree</em> doesn&#039;t bother making its trunk and branches cylindrical because an<strong> ellipse</strong> is good enough.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 15-7-2012(1): <em>Trees</em> that are <em>lazy</em> spend a lot of time lying down rather than standing up like most trees, and the force of gravity squishes them into the shape of an<strong> ellipse</strong>.
