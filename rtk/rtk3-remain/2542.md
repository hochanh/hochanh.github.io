## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 21-6-2007(33): The <em>East</em> are the best at <a href="../v4/2030.html">tempering</a> (#2030 錬) because their <em>fires</em> are the best at<strong> firing</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 5-2-2007(14): The process of<strong> firing</strong>, that is, glaze bricks or refine metals, is well known in the <em>east</em>, and of course <em>fire</em> is used for it.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/einahpets">einahpets</a>] 26-7-2012(2): <strong>Firing</strong> bricks （ 煉瓦 れんが）became really important in Chicago after the Great Chicago Fire - in this kanji you can see the <em>fire</em> to the left and it stops to the <em>east</em> because of the lake.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/billyclyde">billyclyde</a>] 1-11-2007(1): <strong>Firing</strong> metals and pottery and bricks, esp. bricks. So you put out a FIRE and then have the chief smelter YAO MING of the EAST fire it, soot all over his face as he pulls out the fired bricks.
