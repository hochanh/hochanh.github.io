## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama">MeisterLlama</a>] 29-11-2008(28): From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto</a>: Whenever a child is born in Japan, a local Shinto shrine adds the child&#039;s name to a list kept at the shrine and declares him or her a &quot;family child&quot; ( 氏子 ujiko?). After death an ujiko becomes a &quot;family spirit&quot;, or &quot;family kami&quot; ( 氏神 ujigami?). Therefore, if your <em>family name</em> is inscribed in the <em>altar</em>, then you will become a <strong>local god</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 27-1-2007(18): The <em>altar</em> dedicated to this<strong> local god</strong> has the <em>family names</em> of all the villagers inscribed in it, so that the god knows whom he should favour.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Haych">Haych</a>] 6-11-2012(1): The<strong> local god</strong>&#039;s a cool guy. We go to the <em>altar</em> to hang out. I used his <em>family name</em> and he told me that that&#039;s much too formal and I should just his first name.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 7-10-2011(1): 神祇事務局 , 神祇官 =かみづかさ=じんぎかん, 祇園祭 , <a href="../v4/2600.html">local god</a> (#2600 祇) ギ ... Parts:礻, 氏 ...
