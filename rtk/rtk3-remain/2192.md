## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 8-11-2008(28): I was relieved to find my stolen <em>lovedoll</em> tied to some<strong> railing</strong>. She&#039;s a bit <em>dirty</em> but still good!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 14-10-2008(11): A<strong> railing</strong> prevents museum patrons from getting <em>soil</em> on the <em>voodoo dolls</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 24-7-2009(6): The <em>ninja</em> sprinkled a thin powder of fine <em>soil</em> along the hand<strong> railing</strong>, so he would know if anyone had walked down the staircase - if the <em>soil</em> were disturbed, he would find another way out.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 4-5-2008(6): Soil, lovedoll: In the museum, a new<strong> railing</strong> was installed as a preparation for the new exhibit: a <em>lovedoll</em> made of baked <em>soil</em>. The <em>lovedoll</em> is dated to be more than 5000 years old, but is very well preserved. The<strong> railing</strong> is installed to avoid... incidents.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adrianbarritt">adrianbarritt</a>] 12-12-2007(4): <em>Pinnochio</em> went to his first horse race. But he got too close the<strong> railing</strong>s and was covered by flying <em>soil</em> as the horses went past.
