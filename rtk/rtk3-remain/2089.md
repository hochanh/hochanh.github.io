## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 8-3-2008(56): Subject to even more cruel experiments in the name of biological science, the <em>one-human-legged chihuahua</em> is injected with chemicals that alters his <em>shape</em> grotesquely, and makes him as<strong> immense</strong> as a <em>cliff</em> (see how he&#039;s tall enough, standing right beneath it, to reach the top?).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ma3xiu1">ma3xiu1</a>] 24-5-2010(7): Ooh, what&#039;s that<strong> immense</strong> <em>shape</em> dancing of the face of that <em>cliff</em>? Oh, don&#039;t worry, it&#039;s just that little <em>chihuahua with a human leg</em> escaped from the lab, playing around in front of the flashlight.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 5-7-2009(4): Under the cliff, the<strong> immense</strong> chihuahua with one human leg turns out to be understandably none other than Mystique!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tuuli">tuuli</a>] 6-11-2008(4): When I think of<strong> immense</strong> I think of something like the Grand Canyon, with its <em>cliffs</em> that, understandably, before science we could not understand how they were <em>shaped</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 23-4-2007(4): This pup is <strong>immense</strong>! It&#039;s head is almost level with the edge of this tall <em>cliff</em>. Who ever heard of a <em>chihuahua with a human leg</em> with a <em>shape</em> so <strong>immense</strong>?
