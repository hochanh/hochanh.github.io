## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 12-12-2008(50): (Note that per Heisig, this doesn&#039;t mean &#039;able to cut&#039;; it means mentally<strong> sharp</strong>, adept, or &#039;on your toes&#039;!) During the <em>Ice</em> Age, cavemen had to be especially careful around the woolly mammoth, because they were more mentally <em>sharp</em> than they looked. If the cavemen weren&#039;t careful, they could end up impaled on the mammoths&#039; <em>tusks</em>!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shirahime">shirahime</a>] 10-1-2008(18): A<strong> sharp</strong> tusk pointing out of the ice. Probably belongs to a mammoth.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pauline">Pauline</a>] 23-5-2007(12): The <em>ice</em>-age mammoth was very<strong> sharp</strong> and knew how to make use of its <em>tusks</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 15-7-2009(7): &quot;That boy&#039;s as<strong> sharp</strong> as an <em>iced tusk</em>,&quot; went the popular expression back in the days when kanji were being invented. <em>Ice</em> of course can be<strong> sharp</strong> to the touch at times, as can <em>tusks</em>, so naturally an <em>iced tusk</em> was one of the<strong> sharp</strong>est things around back then (hence the simile).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 14-2-2007(5): A <em>tusk</em><strong> sharp</strong> enough to cut <em>ice</em>.
