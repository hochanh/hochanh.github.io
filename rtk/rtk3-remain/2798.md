## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 29-11-2008(25): Remember that dazzling <em>evening</em> where you found the <em>magic wand</em> and used it on your <em>crotch</em> to make it bigger? Well this time you use the wand to disguise your little guy as <em>food</em> so that she thinks it&#039;s a<strong> repast</strong>. <a href="../v4/2543.html">dazzling</a> (#2543 燦).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 17-7-2007(10): What <em>dazzling food</em>! This shall be the most splendid<strong> repast</strong> yet!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/richcoop">richcoop</a>] 30-6-2009(3): 燦 dazzling His<strong> repast</strong> was a MAGIC WAND in the EVENING pulled from his CROTCH that he had to eat.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 6-2-2011(2): To keep this separate from other keywords, I&#039;m going to give this the connotation of left-overs since the word past is in<strong> repast</strong>. After the crazy night with the <em>stripper</em>, the only <em>food</em> left in the fridge is pizza left-overs. It makes a good<strong> repast</strong> though.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 25-3-2010(1): Before the <a href="../v4/2543.html">dazzling</a> (#2543 燦) Independance Day &#039;fire&#039; works begin, everyone <em>eats</em> a<strong> repast</strong> which traditionally didn&#039;t include &#039;rice&#039;. [thanks bodhisamaya for <a href="../v4/2543.html">dazzling</a> (#2543 燦) story].
