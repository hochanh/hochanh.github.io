## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 16-2-2007(27): It used to be that for a meeting [old] you&#039;d <em>meet</em> for a <em>day</em> to get the <em>small</em> details <em>pent in</em>. Even then such meetings were still held under the<strong> Japanese cypress</strong> [old].

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 26-3-2010(7): For <strong>Meeting (old) </strong>會 at <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/26371">Unicode-0x6703</a> (#26371 會). <em>Pent-in + small</em> is pictograph of &quot;a pair of glasses with windscreen wipers&quot; like something out of a joke shop. STORY: In the olden days we couldn&#039;t afford a roof, so we would <em>meet</em> alfresco. Our <em>spectacles had built in wipers</em> so we could continue working during inclement weather. The <strong>meetings (old)</strong> were long and would often last until <em>sundown</em>. Those were the days! Note: So for<strong> Japanese cypress</strong> (old) simply replace 会 in <a href="../v4/2495.html">Japanese cypress</a> (#2495 桧) with 會.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 22-1-2010(3): Long ago, the<strong> JAPANESE CYPRESS</strong> [old] was the best TREE to have a MEETING. Even though everyone was PENT IN the rather SMALL area under the tree&#039;s cover, it was pleasant enough that they could be there all DAY.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/enryu">enryu</a>] 5-9-2009(3): You wait as <em>days</em> pass, <em>pent in</em> a <em>little</em> <em>wooden</em> cage, until you are summoned for a <em>meeting</em> with the <em>old<strong> Japanese Cypress</strong></em> in which she sets you free.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 9-1-2010(1): Let the middle primitive of <em>meeting</em> = <em>broken window</em>. The people meet to discuss the recent outbreak of <em>window smashing</em> after the <em>sun</em> goes down. Story: Even in the old days, people <em>met</em> at the<strong> Japanese Cypress</strong>.
