## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 17-3-2008(57): While &quot;<strong>autochthonous</strong>&quot; can mean &quot;indigenous&quot; in ENGLISH, that is NOT one of the potential meanings of this character (thus, the majority of these stories will not help you with meaning). Rather, the kanji is &quot;autochthonous&quot; in the sense of being Earthly, mystic, and portentous (the ancient, primitive, sacred power of DIRT and SOIL). A vague, poorly-chosen keyword all around. Mantixen&#039;s story does the best job of conveying accurate meaning--&gt; &quot;A <em>monkey</em> likes the <strong>earthy/autochthonous</strong> feel of <em>soil</em>&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(33): A <em>monkey</em> likes the <strong>earthy</strong> feel of <em>soil</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 16-2-2009(9): When it saw the keyword for this kanji, the <em>monkey</em> <em>soiled</em> itself...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 29-8-2010(5): I&#039;ve never seen this word before, so I&#039;m just going to say it&#039;s the name of a Pokemon.<strong> Authochthonous</strong> is a giant monkey made of dirt with all sorts of &quot;earthy&quot; attacks.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 15-1-2009(5): Heisig explains this has meaning of &quot;earthly&quot; in Chinese astrology. Replace the altar with soil in 神 and you have<strong> authochthonous</strong> diety.
