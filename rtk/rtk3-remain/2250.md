## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 1-5-2007(41): In <em>Nara</em>, they do not accept はんこ, in fact their seals are done by simply <strong>impressing</strong> <em>fingers</em> into hot melting wax (fingerprints are unique!).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 23-7-2009(11): In <em>Nara</em>, you<strong> impress</strong> wax seals with just your <em>finger</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum">oregum</a>] 10-1-2009(3): Don&#039;t stick your FINGERS into this NARA<strong> impress</strong>ion until it drys.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 18-11-2009(2): &quot;If you don&#039;t have a はんこ just use your FINGER,&quot; says the NARA city office employee. &quot;Use it here to to make an<strong> IMPRESS</strong>ion on the document.&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 28-7-2008(2): [+ikmys] <em>Fingers</em> the thief is hiding from the law and needs to create a new identity for himself. He flees to <em>Nara</em>, where he hears that they don&#039;t have hanko - just finger <strong>impress</strong>es in wax. First he needs a new finger <strong>impress</strong> though - so he sneaks into a <em>Nara</em> <em>altar</em> and cuts off one <em>finger</em> of the holy <em>dog</em> that sits on top. He attaches that to his own finger and goes to city hall, getting his own wax finger<strong> impress</strong> and thus his new (doggy) identity.
