## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 12-6-2008(23): Mouth, shakuhachi: The hookers <em>mouth</em> was huge and also she was very skilled in &#039;<em>shakuhachi</em>&#039;: she could hold up to one <strong>foot</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 2-8-2009(10): Whenever my girlfriend puts a <strong>foot</strong>long in her <em>mouth</em> I want her to give me a <em>shakuhachi</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 19-3-2010(9): 口 + 尺 = <a href="midori://search?text=呎・フィート">呎・フィート</a> <strong> feet</strong>. Note: <a href="midori://search?text=尺・しゃく">尺・しゃく</a> is being combined with 口 in same way as <a href="../v4/2950.html">mile</a> (#2950 哩) to signal analogy between <em>shaku</em> and<strong> feet</strong>. 尺 is about 3ocm - slightly under a foot.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 16-1-2009(4): This means<strong> feet</strong> in the sense of measurement. A shaku is about the same length as a foot (~30cm) and Heisig explains that adding the mouth on the left often signals a phonetic reading of the kanji, in this case ふいいと.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/krbtwo">krbtwo</a>] 9-2-2010(3): The distance in<strong> feet</strong> from your mouth to the end of the shakuhachi is about one foot.
