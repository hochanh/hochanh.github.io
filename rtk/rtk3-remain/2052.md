2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 6-10-2007(16): The <em>shoeshiner</em> always starts by cleaning the shoes first with<strong> phosphorus</strong>. This is a bit risky, though, and he sets himself on <em>fire</em> (picture him running around in flames).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 18-12-2006(6): When you see that someone&#039;s American sunglasses are on fire, he&#039;s probably put some<strong> phosphorus</strong> on them to for added Coolness(TM) effect (like 隣 is a neighbor who thinks American sunglasses are the pinnacle of coolness).
