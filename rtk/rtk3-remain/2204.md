## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(52): The <em>woman</em> version of an <em>old man</em> is an<strong> aged woman</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Crowfoot">Crowfoot</a>] 12-4-2008(13): You know an<strong> aged woman</strong>?! I know an <em>old man</em>. We should set them up. (Note: Be careful not to confuse with <a href="../v4/804.html">old woman</a> (#804 婆)).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dancingblade">dancingblade</a>] 10-7-2010(4): (+paasan) This is to avoid confusion with old woman. In this day and <em>age</em>, the <em>woman</em> in a couple will often out-<em>age</em> her <em>old man</em> and become an<strong> aged woman</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paasan">paasan</a>] 6-7-2010(3): To avoid confusion with &#039;old woman&#039;, I&#039;m tweaking the keyword a little. Recall the <em>old man</em> <em>sitting in the dirt having a stroke</em>. In this <strong>age</strong>, his <strong>woman</strong> wont help him, for she&#039;s probably around 20 and will run away with his fortune now..

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dalmim">dalmim</a>] 27-10-2011(1): The<strong> AGED WOMAN</strong> stands by her <em>old man</em>.
