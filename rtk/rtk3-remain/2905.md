## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 8-6-2008(19): Magic wand, crown, 1-eyed valley, crotch: The archeologist was searching for the birthplace of the homo<strong> sapience</strong>. Wearing his <em>magic wand</em> and his divining <em>crown</em>, he was able to located it in the <em>1-eyed valley</em>, somewhere in Bolivia. His <em>crotch</em> got all excited, thinking on all the publicity of finding the birthplace of homo<strong> sapience</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 21-11-2007(14): The <em>magic wand</em> in a guy&#039;s <em>crotch</em> is <em>crowned</em> with <em>one</em> <em>eye</em>, and <em>contains</em> a certain <strong>sapience</strong>... but they should try not to &quot;think with the little head.&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 31-7-2009(5): A <em>magic house</em> with<strong> sapience</strong> has a <em>ceiling</em> that can tell you&#039;ve got your <em>eye</em> on the <em>valley</em> in the girl&#039;s <em>crotch</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BladeWalker">BladeWalker</a>] 27-7-2012(2): <em>One eyed valley</em> + <em>magic wand crown crotch</em> =<strong> sapience</strong>. Makes perfect sense.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 22-3-2010(1): 又 = <em>sitting cross-legged. Wand + crown</em> here suggests a top sorcerer living on the <em>ceiling</em> of the world (in a high place). In the <em>valley</em> below an all seeing <em>eye</em> watches. It&#039;s starting to sound like Sauron. Within his lair, the dark lord <em>sits cross legged</em>, trance like, commanding his evil minions. Clearly<strong> sapience</strong> doesn&#039;t always imply benevolence.
