## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 13-5-2008(32): Flower, decline: After your <em>flowers</em> have <em>declined</em> (i.e., lost their bloom), you can always use the remains to weave a<strong> straw raincoat</strong>. It&#039;s all about recycling these days...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 21-5-2007(23): Looking for a job at a florist during bad weather, I was forced to wear my pauper&#039;s<strong> straw raincoat</strong>. Predictably, I was <em>declined</em> at every <em>flower</em> shop I found.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 24-7-2009(7): <em>Flowery</em> raincoats are on the <em>decline</em>, with<strong> straw raincoat</strong>s now coming into fashion.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 24-4-2007(6): The pathetic guy that was <em>declined</em> at the fancy restaurant, bought a<strong> straw raincoat</strong> while wandering the streets. There were still <em>flowers</em> in the straw.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 14-6-2009(3): Imagine Aeris in her<strong> straw raincoat</strong>, going from corner to corner trying to sell <em>flowers</em>, but being <em>declined</em> each time.
