## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 26-11-2008(50): <em>Spiderman</em>&#039;s a <em>strange</em> guy, wearing such<strong> ornate</strong> outfits to make himself look 綺麗 【きれい】.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 16-3-2008(7): SPIDERMAN wears such STRANGE outfits, that they seem almost<strong> ORNATE</strong> compared to the thugs he captures.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 28-7-2009(4): <em>Spider-Man</em> looks <em>strange</em> in his<strong> ornate</strong> costume, but that&#039;s why you can&#039;t take your eyes off of him.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 18-7-2007(3): What appears to many as <em>strange</em> <em>thread</em>, when woven, becomes something extrordinarily<strong> ornate</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 15-12-2009(2): <em>Spider-Man</em>&#039;s enemies have<strong> ornate</strong> outfits - outside the colourful pages of a comic book, this would look very <em>strange</em>. (This is the main reason they didn&#039;t use the traditional,<strong> ornate</strong> outfits of the X-Men in those movies - Wolverine would have just looked too 綺麗 .).
