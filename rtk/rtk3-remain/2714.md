## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 28-7-2009(36): When you<strong> split up</strong> from your partner, you say <em>words</em> that cut things off for good, like a <em>guillotine</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 31-5-2008(15): Words, guillotine: The prisoner was given the opportunity to speak a final <em>word</em>, before the <em>guillotine</em> would do its&#039; work. He made a morbid joke, saying to his chest: &quot;Here&#039;s head speaking. Let&#039;s<strong> split up</strong>.&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 24-7-2007(5): <em>Words</em> are the metaphorical <em>guillotine</em> used to<strong> split up</strong> relationships between people.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hissatsu">hissatsu</a>] 19-11-2010(1): Any last <em>words</em> before you&#039;re<strong> split up</strong> by the <em>guillotine</em>?

Everything went exactly as planned when the <em>guillotine</em> did its job, the man said the funny <em>words</em> when his head was <strong>separated</strong> from his body, and everyone<strong> split up</strong> with laughter.
