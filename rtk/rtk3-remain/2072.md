## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 29-7-2009(41): In the <strong><em>rice-field</em> footpath</strong> I found a <em>condom</em> (used to protect you from the one in four crotches that shouldn&#039;t be done ヌde) of someone who couldn&#039;t afford a hotel.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 4-11-2008(23): PRIMITIVE: Four crotches = orgy. The <strong><em>rice-field</em> footpaths</strong> were where we used to have <em>orgies</em> back in the day.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 11-8-2006(19): The<strong> rice-field footpath</strong>s that run through the <em>rice fields</em> look like embroidery <em>stitching</em> from afar.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 17-9-2007(9): <em>Rope ladder</em>, like as found on the side of a large ship. The<strong> rice-field footpath</strong> depicted here is actually a <em>rope ladder</em> suspended a metre above the <em>rice field</em>. Don&#039;t let your limbs slip through!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 23-5-2008(7): The<strong> RICE-FIELD FOOTPATH</strong> obviously is around the RICE-FIELD. You&#039;ll see that on the ridge, the FOOTPATH is rice reeds that have been STICHED together to form a FOOTPATH over the ridge so that you don&#039;t slip into the RICE-FIELD and holds the ridge together.
