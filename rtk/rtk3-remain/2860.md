## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 20-7-2007(22): I hop into my<strong> palanquin</strong>, my <em>car</em> of sorts, such that I may be transported to my next location of <em>entertainment</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 30-7-2009(17): A<strong> palanquin</strong> is a <em>car</em> used for the <em>entertainment</em> of royalty when they want to take a joyride.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 25-3-2010(2): A<strong> palanquin</strong> is not exactly the same as a <em>car</em>, but it&#039;s a hell of a lot more <em>entertaining</em> to watch!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 9-3-2010(2): Before there were <em>cars</em>, the lesser nobility (who lived in small towns with only one long main street) used to be carried up and down the street in their<strong> palanquin</strong>s for <em>entertainment</em>. Little has changed today, but this activity is available to all youths with <em>cars</em> and little better to do.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjisensei">kanjisensei</a>] 22-10-2009(1): Although they used to be used for real, nowadays in old towns in Japan, tourists can ride in a<strong> Palanquin</strong> car for their entertainment. As each<strong> palanquin</strong> is hand-made, none of them are the same!
