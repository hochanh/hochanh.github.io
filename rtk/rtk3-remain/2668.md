## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 26-11-2008(14): The <em>rice seedlings</em> notice that <em>Spiderman</em>&#039;s blocking their path to the promised land. So they put on <strong>da mask</strong> which was made of a figured cloth and managed to outsmart spidey.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 18-7-2007(11): Those <em>rice-seedlings</em> on <em>walking legs</em> had to carry this <em>thread</em> all the way from the middle east to introduce the beautiful<strong> damask</strong> to the Japanese.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 9-8-2009(6): <strong>Damask</strong>: a firm lustrous fabric made with flat patterns in a satin weave on a plain-woven ground on jacquard looms. Sounds fancy. Clearly not the kind of <em>threads</em> you should wear while planting <em>rice seedlings</em> and <em>walking</em> around in the field.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 28-7-2009(3): <em>Spider-Man</em>&#039;s <em>ex</em> left him because he wouldn&#039;t take off<strong> damask</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Haych">Haych</a>] 10-11-2012(2): <em>Spiderman</em> takes off <strong>da mask</strong> to check his sight when he thinks he sees a bunch of <em>rice seedlings</em> with <em>walking legs</em>.
