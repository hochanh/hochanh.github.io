## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 1-5-2007(29): The <em>state of mind</em> of the <em>tall child</em> whom <em>receives</em> all of the attention is often surprisingly<strong> considerate</strong>. They have known nothing but kindness in their life, and thus act the same in return!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 23-7-2009(14): A<strong> considerate</strong> <em>state of mind</em> is open to <em>receive</em> others&#039; input.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 14-1-2009(10): Data is only<strong> considerate</strong> of tall children, he&#039;s a real dick to short kids.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 6-4-2010(3): Being<strong> CONSIDERATE</strong> means to always be in a <em>STATE OF MIND</em> that is <em>receptive</em>, i.e. ready to <em>RECEIVE</em> what others communicate, either verbally or more subtly. (thx nolusu, mantixen, n1williams).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Green_Airplane">Green_Airplane</a>] 31-5-2009(3): Whenever I&#039;m in a<strong> considerate</strong> <em>state of mind</em>, the beggars always <em>receive</em> something from me. (OK, not exactly true ;P).
