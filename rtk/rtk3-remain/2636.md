## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 26-5-2008(28): Bamboo, in front: Martial arts movie. The hero walks through a <em>bamboo</em> forest, and suddenly an<strong> arrow shaft</strong> stands quivering in the <em>bamboo</em> tree just <em>in front</em> of him. Time for some action scenes.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 21-12-2009(9): If you suddenly see bamboo sticking out in front of you, it&#039;s most likely an<strong> arrow shaft</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(4): <em>Bamboo</em> forms the<strong> arrow shaft</strong> you shoot <em>in front</em> of you.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Haych">Haych</a>] 9-11-2012(2): The sorcerer freezes the arrow right <em>in front</em> of him in mid air, and then plucks it out of the air and snaps the weak <em>bamboo</em><strong> arrow shaft</strong> in two.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 6-3-2010(2): A fletcher has pieces of <em>bamboo</em> laid <em>in front</em> of him. He selects one and begins to make an<strong> arrow shaft</strong>. Hint: To avoid using 木 instead of <em>bamboo</em>, I think of &quot;bamboo for Bambi&quot; - the final destiny of this arrow.
