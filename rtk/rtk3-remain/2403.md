## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-7-2009(23): The idiot savant was thought to be a<strong> quack</strong> because he couldn&#039;t help but count the <em>number</em> of <em>flowers</em> he saw.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 4-12-2008(23): I don&#039;t even know where Heisig got this keyword from. Using &quot;thicket&quot; instead: Picture a thicket with a large number of flowers.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 10-5-2010(19): Notes: Keyword &quot;quack&quot; was presumably chosen due to its use in the compound 薮医者 , but the general meaning of this kanji is bush/thicket. Also note that it mostly appears in its alternate form: 藪.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 13-1-2007(9): The<strong> quack</strong> travels around with a <em>number</em> of impressive looking <em>flowers</em> that are supposed to be good for something, but really don&#039;t work at all.
