## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 19-3-2007(27): On the <em>pinnacle</em> of the secret government organisation, every<strong> nook</strong> and cranny of the pinnacle is under government control, even the <em>ricefields</em>. You can&#039;t even drop a <em>hairpin</em> there without being noticed.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(14): Those <em>apprehensive</em> when they reach the <em>pinnacle</em> often find a<strong> nook</strong> to hide in.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ghinzdra">ghinzdra</a>] 21-9-2009(5): You want to find the<strong> nook</strong> where they hiding in the PINNACLE ? look I hate to ruin the mood but it would be like looking for a HAIRPIN in a whole FIELD . To put it midly I m slighlty APPREHENSIVE .

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dancingblade">dancingblade</a>] 16-7-2010(3): (+astridtops) Every<strong> nook</strong> and cranny of <em>The Pinnacle</em> is under government surveillance. It gives people a good reason to feel <em>apprehensive</em> about visiting.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 30-11-2009(3): With limited space, every<strong> NOOK</strong> and cranny has to be used at THE PINNACLE. There is hardly enough room between FIELDS to squeeze in a HAIRPIN.
