## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(20): <strong>Butterbur</strong> <em>flowers</em> can be seen along the <em>path</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 29-7-2008(19): In Aikita, the<strong> butterbur</strong> grow so huge that they use them to line public walking <em>paths</em>. The large <em>flowers</em> at the top (don&#039;t get it confused - they may look like leaves, but they are really just broad, green <em>flowers</em>) provide shade and make for a very pleasant public <em>path</em> way. Check it: <a href="http://hojinashi.cocolog-nifty.com/photos/uncategorized/101.jpg">http://hojinashi.cocolog-nifty.com/photos/uncategorized/101.jpg</a>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wilsoncb">wilsoncb</a>] 24-8-2010(4): Since<strong> butterbur</strong> means nothing to me, I&#039;ll think of Butterbeer, the beverage from the Harry Potter franchise. Eating too many of the flowers that it&#039;s made from can lead one onto the path of alcoholism...
