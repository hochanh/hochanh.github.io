## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adrianbarritt">adrianbarritt</a>] 15-12-2007(36): I was once served<strong> venison</strong> at <em>home</em>, but the only way I could eat it was to down a <em>six</em> pack first.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 22-10-2007(23): I told my friend the deer I kept in my <em>house</em> for<strong> venison</strong> was called &quot;roku&quot; (<em>six</em>). He asked if naming it didn&#039;t make me attached to it. I said no, because &quot;roku&quot; is also a way to say the kanji for deer.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum">oregum</a>] 9-1-2009(4): The meat for wild animals, such a<strong> venison</strong> is SIX times tastier than HOUSE animals.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 21-3-2011(3): 宍 , <a href="../v4/2216.html">venison</a> (#2216 宍) ニク, しし ... Parts: 宀, 六 (cf 冥土 <a href="../v4/2841.html">Hades</a> (#2841 冥), 暝 <a href="../v4/2843.html">murky</a> (#2843 暝)) ... Note: Only two 漢字 read ニク: 肉 <a href="../v4/1022.html">meat</a> (#1022 肉), and 宍 <a href="../v4/2216.html">venison</a> (#2216 宍) ... Aerin Story remix: The <em>deer</em> I kept in my <em>house</em> for <strong>venison</strong> is named <em>ロク six</em> It&#039;s a joke, because after I hunt him, in my <em>House</em> and kill him, I eat <em>ロク ( 鹿 )</em> for <em>ロク-(6)</em> days.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 28-1-2009(3): A <em>house</em> with the number <em>666</em> and strips of<strong> venison</strong> hanging out front.
