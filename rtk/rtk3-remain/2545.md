## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 11-2-2007(34): With an iron that has been in the <em>fire</em>, <em>each</em> beast is subjected to<strong> branding</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/richcoop">richcoop</a>] 19-7-2009(12): <strong>Branding</strong> with FIRE - EACH animal.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura">taikura</a>] 10-12-2008(2): Farmers use<strong> branding</strong> to protect the property of their flock. They use an iron fresh out of the <em>fire</em> to brand <em>each and every</em> animal with the same <strong>brand</strong>. Thinking more abstractly,<strong> branding</strong> (or advertising) burns like <em>fire</em> in the mind of <em>each and every</em> person exposed to it.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 3-8-2008(2): (see <a href="../v4/292.html">status</a> (#292 格)): The forest ranger finishes figuring out the status of <em>every</em> tree in the forest. &quot;Okays, &quot; says the supervisor. &quot;Now you to be out and<strong> branding</strong> all of these trees, for quickly!&quot;. The ranger does not want to do this - it&#039;s boring, and involves marking <em>each</em> tree with tiny <em>fire</em>s. Wait - here&#039;s an idea! Why don&#039;t I just set a fire at a few spots in the park? That way while one side is<strong> branding</strong>, the other side can be<strong> branding</strong> too! Hence no trees in this kanji - they&#039;re all burned down.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NeoGlitch">NeoGlitch</a>] 13-12-2010(1): I&#039;m<strong> branding</strong> with <em>fire - each</em> animal in my farm (my cows, bulls, pigs, chickens, parrots, worms... oops, poor worms).
