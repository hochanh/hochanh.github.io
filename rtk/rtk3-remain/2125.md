## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 7-11-2008(33): <em>Mr. T</em> is <em>exhausted</em>!<strong> As is</strong> the woman who just gave him <em>shakuhachi</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 5-10-2007(16): You see <em>person</em> holding the <em>exhaust</em> pipe which has just dropped off their new car, and say, &quot;You should return that and get your money back!&quot;. &quot;Trouble is,&quot; they reply, &quot;I bought it<strong> as is</strong>&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 28-6-2008(11): <em>Mr T</em> buys a used car<strong> as is</strong> and gets a great deal. As soon as he gets it off the lot, though, the <em>exhaust</em> <em>freezes</em> and falls off. He stops the car and yells out the window - &quot;Hey, fool, you better give me a refund!&quot; &quot;No, &quot; says the salesman, &quot;you bought that<strong> as is</strong>!&quot;. <em>Mr T</em> calmly steps out of the car, picks up the <em>exhaust</em>, walks over to the salesman, and wraps the <em>exhaust</em> pipe around his neck (causing his neck to <em>freeze</em> from the cold). I pity the fool that runs an<strong> as is</strong> scam.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 5-10-2007(9): &quot;<em>Mr T</em> is <em>exhausted</em>. I will leave these fools<strong> as is</strong>&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 4-12-2009(4): Note: This is a simplified and far less used form of the character 儘. Heisig loves simplified characters for some reason.
