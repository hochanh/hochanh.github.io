## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 2-1-2009(35): <strong>Sedge</strong> is a flower (plant) that looks like grass, much like bureaucrats look a lot like real humans.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 19-5-2009(20): <strong>Sedge</strong> is a very &quot;boring&quot; flower. It just looks like grass. So who would have such a <em>flower</em> in his house but the <em>bureaucrats</em>?

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 7-1-2007(11): The <em>bureaucrats</em> wanted all the<strong> sedge</strong> <em>plants</em> in the district counted. Whatever will they think of next...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 29-11-2009(2): <strong>SEDGE</strong> is a FLOWERING plant that is a lot like BUREAUCRAT. There are about 4,000 species of them and left to their own they&#039;ll continue to proliferate.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-7-2009(2): The <em>bureaucrat</em> tried smoking<strong> sedge</strong> <em>flowers</em> because someone told him it looked like &quot;grass&quot;.
