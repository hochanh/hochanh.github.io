1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 21-4-2007(52): This is a<strong> violet</strong> <em>cabbage</em>, hanging from a <em>nail</em> on the kitchen wall.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/woelpad">woelpad</a>] 3-3-2008(20): <strong>Violet</strong>s are blue, <em>cabbages</em> are green. <em>Flowers</em> on a <em>spike</em> are a sight rarely seen.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 14-2-2007(13): If you put <em>cabbage</em> underneath the <em>floor</em>, <strong>violets</strong> are the <em>flowers</em> that will grow up through the cracks.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 4-12-2010(5): 菫色 , 三色菫 , <a href="../v4/2099.html">violet</a> (#2099 菫) (キン), すみれ ... Parts: Cabbage (RTK 1575.9) with an extra line. (cf. 謹む <a href="../v4/1576.html">discreet</a> (#1576 謹), 勤める <a href="../v4/1577.html">diligence</a> (#1577 勤), 僅か <a href="../v4/2116.html">trifle</a> (#2116 僅), 飢饉 <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/39241">Unicode-0x9949</a> (#39241 饉)) ... Story: This kanji refers to the <em>Flower</em> <strong>Violet</strong>, not to the color <strong>Violet</strong>, even thought the clever way to remember it is as <strong>Violet</strong> <em>Cabbage</em> with a little extra.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Machine_Gun_Cat">Machine_Gun_Cat</a>] 6-7-2009(3): I HATE<strong> violet</strong> <em>cabbages</em> so much that when I was served a dish containing them at a friends house I hurled my dish up into the <em>ceiling</em> in disgust, I tried to make up for the incident by giving them <em>flowers</em> but they still haven&#039;t invited me back.
