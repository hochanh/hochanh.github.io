## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 4-5-2007(25): This region only has<strong> sparse</strong> agriculture. The few farmers <em>hope</em> their <em>wheat</em> crops will do well, but the soil isn&#039;t really good.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 15-7-2010(17): Food is<strong> sparse</strong>, so the <em>wheat</em> crops are now their only <em>hope</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 3-12-2008(7): Scarce is a better keyword since this really means rare. Here, the farmer hopes he gets some wheat during the harvest since food is scarce.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 7-10-2011(4): 稀に =希に, 稀ガス =希ガス, 稀薄 =希薄, 稀釈 =希釈, 稀有 =希有, 稀代 =希代, <a href="../v4/2611.html">sparse</a> (#2611 稀)キ, まれに ... Parts:禾, 希 (cf 希釈 <a href="../v4/1489.html">hope</a> (#1489 希)) ... Note: This is an old form, simplified into 希 , and can be freely replaced by 希 in all but place/people names. 希 has separate meanings, but all of 稀 &#039;s meaning have been folded into 希 . ... Story: I <em>Hope</em> misidentified Kanji are <strong>Sparse</strong> from here out, and that it is not a <em>Cereal/Serial</em> thing, but <em>Wheat/Wait</em> there are more.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 25-11-2008(3): With any decent rainfall being<strong> sparse</strong>, the <em>wheat</em> farmers <em>hope</em> that things will change soon.
