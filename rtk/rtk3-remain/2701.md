## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 28-7-2009(42): A monk&#039;s sash is a <em>garment</em> that has <em>grains of sand</em> in it from beachside meditations.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 16-11-2010(3): 袈裟 , 大袈裟な <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/2701">monk's sash</a> (#2701 裟)サ ... Parts: 沙 <a href="../v4/2296.html">grains of sand</a> (#2296 沙), 衣 ... Note: 袈裟 only compound for 袈 <a href="../v4/2700.html">stole</a> (#2700 袈)裟<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/2701">monk's sash</a> (#2701 裟) ... Story: Like <em>Grains of Sand</em> through the hourglass measures time, a <strong>Monk&#039;s Sash</strong>ay through the abbey can mark the time for the initiates. Each time through he removes another Garment, till he is a sky-clad monk. Well except for the <strong>Monk&#039;s Sash</strong>. That he keeps on.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/woelpad">woelpad</a>] 29-7-2008(3): The <strong>monk</strong> stashes <em>grains of sand</em> in his <strong>sash</strong> and hides it under his <em>garment</em>. Probably emptied the hourglass to hasten dinner time.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 25-2-2010(1): Monks hate going to the beach because their <strong>monk&#039;s sash</strong> is the perfect <em>garment</em> for trapping <em>grains of sand</em>, which irritate them as they walk home. They obviously can&#039;t just untie the <strong>sash</strong> and shake them out, because they aren&#039;t wearing anything underneath.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 30-10-2009(1): Adrian Monk&#039;s sash got <em>grains of sand</em> in it. Before you could say Jack Robinson the only <em>garment</em>s he was wearing were his <em>top hat</em> and <em>scarf</em>.
