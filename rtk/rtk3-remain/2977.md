## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 3-12-2008(19): The <strong>alternative<strong> summit</strong></strong> is so steep that the <em>mountain is above</em> you rather than beside you. People usually just go with the regular<strong> summit</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 31-3-2010(4): Logically, an <strong>alternate</strong> way to arrange the primitives for 峰 <a href="../v4/1562.html">summit</a> (#1562 峰) is to have 山 on top where it rightfully belongs.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 4-10-2009(4): The couple have a <em>tryst</em> just below the alternate mountain<strong> summit</strong>, where no one goes anymore.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 14-6-2008(3): Mountain, walking through the bushes: The hippies didn&#039;t want to climb the entire <em>mountain</em> and decided to go to the &#039;<strong>alternative<strong> summit</strong></strong>&#039; which involved <em>walking through the bushes</em> below the <em>mountain</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 2-8-2009(2): An alternate type of environmental<strong> summit</strong> arranges the <em>mountain</em> above the <em>walking legs</em> and <em>Smart Cars</em> necessary to reduce energy consumption and emissions.
