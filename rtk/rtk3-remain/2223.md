## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 31-1-2007(46): This<strong> folding screen</strong> looks quite pretty, with all the national flags printed on it, but folding and unfolding it is rather complicated. It looks more like a <em>puzzle</em> than a utility item.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 22-11-2008(27): Someone took an old <a href="../v4/1056.html">fence</a> (#1056 塀), brushed the <em>dirt</em> off it and turned it into a<strong> folding screen</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 27-12-2008(4): I&#039;m throwing up the white <em>flag</em> of surrender after having to put together yet another Ikea<strong> folding screen</strong>. They fit together like a <em>puzzle</em>, and I&#039;ve had quite enough of trying to put together these <em>puzzles</em> for one day.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869">perrin4869</a>] 10-7-2010(2): I bought a<strong> folding screen</strong>, but it turns out that it was more of a do-it-yourself kind of puzzle to put together! I raised the white flag in surrender after a few hours of struggling.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum">oregum</a>] 9-1-2009(1): The<strong> folding screen</strong> is decorated with FLAGS, but its like a PUZZLE to open and close this thing. <a href="../v4/1056.html">fence</a> (#1056 塀).
