## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 16-2-2007(37): The <em>day</em> seems to<strong> drag</strong> when it keeps you from having a <em>fiesta</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 27-4-2008(15): Bored with the <em>sun</em> always going the same way (“it’s such a<strong> drag</strong>”), I tuck the <em>sun under my arm</em> and try to<strong> drag</strong> it in the opposite direction to usual. EDIT: Notes (1): <em>tucked under the arm</em> is reversed here, i.e. a mirror image of the usual primitive. Note (2): <strong>Tow</strong> might be a better keyword: see my note at <a href="../v4/2849.html">dribble out</a> (#2849 洩).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 5-11-2010(10): 曳光弾 , 曳く , 曳き船 =引き船=曵船, 曳航 <a href="../v4/2848.html">drag</a> (#2848 曳) エイ, ひく ... Parts: 日 , 戈- 丶 (cf 洩らす <a href="../v4/2849.html">dribble out</a> (#2849 洩)) ... Note: this Kanji is confusing until you look at its older form 曵. It&#039;s not ’Under the arm’ but rather 戈Fiesta with one stroke doubled up with 日 . Often replaced by 引く in modern times. Old version 曵 is used in the Hikifune ( 曵船 ) place name in Tokyo. ... Story:The <em>Fiesta</em> can certainly<strong> Drag</strong> if it goes all day <em>Without a Drop</em> to drink.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nac_est">nac_est</a>] 6-11-2008(2): The <em>sun</em>, as we all know, is very heavy. So the <strong>drag</strong> it generates when carrying it under your arm makes it a tiring burden.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 17-2-2011(1): It was a real<strong> drag</strong> when the <em>sun</em> dried up the last <em>drop</em> to drink at the <em>fiesta</em>.
