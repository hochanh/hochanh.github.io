## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 31-10-2006(24): All the grain that was spilled under the <em>tree</em> looked like a <em>mosaic</em>, but someone took a<strong> grain rake</strong> and disposed of it.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 14-2-2010(12): Dad gave me a<strong> grain rake</strong> and told me to go and rake the grain, but since this is the most boring task in the whole world, I climbed a <em>tree</em> and played with my <em>Rubik&#039;s cube</em> instead.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 6-3-2010(2): The <em>wood</em> used in this<strong> grain rake</strong> has a unique <em>mosaic</em> grain pattern.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 21-11-2010(1): (Thanks Meconium) A monk who is sick of raking sand with his<strong> grain rake</strong> goes and hides in a tree and plays with a rubik&#039;s cube.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Panta">Panta</a>] 20-3-2013(): To me, raking grains/using a<strong> grain rake</strong> is about as tedious as solving a <em>Rubik&#039;s cube</em>. <em>Wood</em> is used because you can&#039;t expect a tool for such a menial task to be made of metal.
