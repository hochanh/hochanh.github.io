The first emotion he feels, though, is<strong> infatuation</strong> for Seven of Nine...he can&#039;t get her out of his <em>heart</em>. It starts to interfere with his work, and he decides that enough is enough. He can&#039;t very well throw away the <em>heart</em> (it would offend the captain), but he has to do something...so he pulls his new <em>heart</em> out of his body, and ties it in a <em>knot</em>. No more<strong> infatuation</strong>.
