## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 12-6-2008(28): Mouth, computer: The <em>mouth</em> on my navigation <em>computer</em> tells me it&#039;s only a<strong> mile</strong> left to my destination.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 28-5-2009(5): Blah, blah, blah. After a<strong> mile</strong> of listening to the <em>mouth</em> of the guy I was commuting with, I stuffed a <em>computer</em> into his mouth to shut him up. I imagine we won&#039;t be riding together tomorrow.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dtcamero">dtcamero</a>] 19-4-2011(4): One RI is approximately equal to one<strong> MILE</strong>. The MOUTH indicates that this is a western measurement. (see TON).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 2-8-2009(2): A <em>computer</em> with a <em>mouth</em> could talk a<strong> mile</strong> a minute.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 20-3-2010(1): Both the <em>ri</em> and the<strong> mile</strong> <a href="midori://search?text=哩・マイル">哩・マイル</a> are traditional units of measure which existed before the kilometre. In that respect they are analogous - unlike 口 in <a href="../v4/2949.html">ton</a> (#2949 噸) which is used to signal a phonetic (rather than semantic) use of the kanji. Note: Contrary to RTK3 2nd ed, a <a href="../v4/173.html">ri</a> (#173 里) is about 2.5 times longer than a<strong> mile</strong>. See RTK1 for correct measure.
