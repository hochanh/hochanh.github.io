## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 15-12-2008(43): The churches teach that if we eliminate <em>horniness</em> as a <em>universal</em> trait, we can make<strong> progress</strong> as a society.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 8-6-2007(7): Thinking of “The Pilgrim’s<strong> Progress</strong>”, imagine the pilgrim is stuck outside the universe 普 , trying to get in. But the universe is surrounded by horns which block his path. Once he removes the <em>horns</em> from the <em>universe</em>, then he can make<strong> progress</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/coolbananas">coolbananas</a>] 22-8-2009(3): Is read シン and refers to the Jin (or Tsin) Dynasty in China in the 3rd century. Then there was a Later Jin Dynasty and other Jins using the character 金 . Appears in name of Shansi province. Appears in names like PM 安倍晋三 . Otherwise, it&#039;s a useless kanji! Why is it here? Are we studying Chinese now?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-7-2009(3): I started making<strong> progress</strong> in my life when I stopped spending my <em>day</em> being horny over <em>Star Wars</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 7-6-2010(2): This is an ancient realization, going back to the surprisingly <strong>PROGRESSIVE JIN DYNASTY</strong>: the <em>only</em> thing getting in the way of <strong>PROGRESS</strong> in the area of population control is our <em>UNIVERSAL HORN</em>iness.
