## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 3-2-2007(32): He had a curious form of<strong> measles</strong> : the red marks on his skin were all in the <em>shape</em> of an <em>umbrella</em>. The doctors of course couldn&#039;t explain it...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 6-8-2009(5): I&#039;m<em> sick</em> with the<strong> measles</strong>. Whenever I go out, I carry my<em> parasol</em> to try and cover up the rash.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dancingblade">dancingblade</a>] 19-8-2010(2): A: &quot;Hey, its a fine day today, why are you hiding under that <em>parasol</em>?&quot; B: &quot;Don&#039;t come near me! I&#039;m <em>sick</em> with the<strong> measles</strong>. It spreads with <em>parasol</em> transmission!&quot; A: &quot;Are you sure it wasn&#039;t &#039;aerosol&#039;?&quot; B: &quot;...&quot; (cough).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 17-2-2010(2): While <em>Bruce Lee</em> was nervously waiting for his <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1724">check-up</a> (#1724 診) at the doctor&#039;s surgery, the <em>caveman</em>, who was suffering from the<strong> measles</strong>, coughed all over <em>Bruce</em>. He tried to prevent the infectious microdroplets from reaching him by opening his <em>umbrella</em> against the spray with lightning-fast reflexes. Unfortunately though, despite his quick response, <em>Bruce</em> inhaled some droplets accidentally, and knowing his fate, sat down next to the <em>caveman</em> for quick treatment.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 27-7-2009(2): After his <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1724">check-up</a> (#1724 診), the monk was told he had the<strong> measles</strong>, probably from his measly attire given the weather conditions.
