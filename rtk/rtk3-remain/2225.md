## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 23-3-2008(29): The next step on the <em>sentient rice-seedlings; journey</em>, after their miraculous <a href="../v4/2136.html">pull through</a> (#2136 凌) from being trapped: mountains in the distance, extremely <strong>rugged mountains</strong>, and nowhere to go next but through them.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 15-11-2009(8): When trying to cross<strong> RUGGED MOUNTAINS</strong> you&#039;ll feel like you have RICE SEEDLINGS for WALKING LEGS.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 14-2-2008(7): <strong>Rugged mountains</strong> are <em>mountains</em> which have &quot;black <em>diamond</em>&quot; (expert level) ski slopes, and no <em>flowers</em> can grow there. (The part on the right is 菱 <a href="../v4/1517.html">diamond</a> (#1517 菱), minus flowers.).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 5-7-2008(2): Ah,<strong> RUGGED MOUNTAINS</strong> were too much MOUNTAIN for FRODO and the FELLOWSHIP to go over. In the Kanji story, they went beside the MOUNTAINS and not under them.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lankydan">lankydan</a>] 13-9-2007(2): <em>Diamonds (whole thing on right)</em> scattered at the<strong> rugged mountains</strong>. Check out all these diamonds.
