## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 24-7-2007(24): In Japanese RPGs, you are well advised to <em>add</em> a<strong> stole</strong> to your <em>clothing</em> as a &quot;freebie&quot; way to <em>add</em> defensive points without swapping out some other <em>garment</em>. But since you can&#039;t find them in the shops, you have to &quot;stole&quot; that<strong> stole</strong> from a glamorous NPC who is ostensibly there to aid your quest.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alucardchuu">alucardchuu</a>] 14-7-2010(13): This<strong> stole</strong> really adds something to your garment, it&#039;s the final touch.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 28-7-2009(5): The<strong> stole</strong> is a <em>garment</em> easy to <em>add</em> to your outfit: just drape it over your shoulders.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 29-6-2007(5): That Buddhist priest<strong> stole</strong> that<strong> stole</strong>: it was like he subtracted some <em>clothes</em> from me and <em>added</em> some <em>clothes</em> to him.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 29-10-2009(3): I <em>add</em>ed a <em>garment</em> and it was <strong>stole</strong>n. I <em>add</em>ed another <em>garment</em> and it too was <strong>stole</strong>n. I <em>add</em>ed a third <em>garment</em>, a mink<strong> stole</strong>, and it was not <strong>stole</strong>n. Of the three garments I <em>add</em>ed, only my<strong> stole</strong> was not <strong>stole</strong>n.
