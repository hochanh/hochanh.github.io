## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 26-4-2007(73): The church is <em>selling</em> holy <em>water</em> for the faithful, but if you dare to say its tap water, they&#039;d tell you you were <strong>blaspheming</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 12-11-2009(4): During the Wedding at Cana, the Son of God had some people come up to complain after he performed his miracle. &quot;This wine is terrible! Are you trying to <em>sell</em> me <em>watered</em>-down wine?&quot; He replied, &quot;It&#039;s a wedding, for God&#039;s sake, the wine is free, so stop complaining.&quot; The dissatisfied guest retorted, &quot;Hey, don&#039;t<strong> blaspheme</strong>!&quot; Jesus Christ just rolled his eyes and, under his breath, uttered his own name in vain.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harpagornes">Harpagornes</a>] 14-10-2011(2): &quot;Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all who were buying and <em>selling</em> there...&quot; Mathew 21:12. In the Japanese version of this event, Jesus drives out the <strong>blasphemers</strong> by throwing <em>water</em> at them. Cf. 売 <a href="../v4/323.html">sell</a> (#323 売).

Don&#039;t spend $4 bucks for a plastic bottle of what you can get from your tap!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(1): Long ago people would<strong> blaspheme</strong> you for trying to <em>sell water</em>.
