## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 31-7-2009(31): The<strong> nightingale</strong> is a <em>bird</em> that goes to a <em>schoolhouse</em> at night to learn to sing.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 20-12-2009(10): This character is actually a 俗字 (unofficial simplification) of the character 鶯. As such, it is actually far less common than the traditional character according to a google search. Story for the correct character: The<strong> nightingale</strong> is bird with a crown (mane) as bright as a deep fire (two fires).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 3-12-2008(2): At the <em>school house</em> we all learnt about some <em>bird</em> named Florence<strong> Nightingale</strong>.

So, teacher got out his shotgun and shot the damn <em>bird</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 18-3-2011(1): (a story that explains both the new and old version of the kanji) The <em>school house</em> burnt down twice in a row (<em>two fires</em>). Finally, the principal thought he had found the culprit. &quot;But it wasn&#039;t it me!&quot; said the kid. &quot;It was a<strong> nightingale</strong>!&quot; &quot;Right kid... EXPELLED!&quot; In the trees, a little <em>bird</em> was laughing.
