## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 1-2-2009(34): At<strong> DAWN</strong>, the SUN starts it&#039;s DAY of work, yes? So doesn&#039;t it need to SIGN IN with with SIGNATURE? Just picture that silly image for this kanji.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 6-10-2007(20): I go out at the crack of<strong> dawn</strong> to buy a newspaper (The <em>Sun</em>), and bump into ex-sumo wrestler Akebono ( 曙 ) who is doing the same. Of course I ask for his <em>signature</em> on my copy of The <em>Sun</em>, which he signs &quot;<strong>Dawn</strong> (Akebono)&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 17-4-2007(6): The <em>sun</em> puts its <em>signature</em> on the <em>day</em> at<strong> dawn</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 4-5-2007(3): The person who was about to be executed waited for<strong> dawn</strong>, because he still hoped the governor would put a <em>signature</em> on his reprieve before the <em>sun</em> came up.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 9-12-2009(2): <strong>DAWN</strong> is when, just like in classic cartoons, the SUN begins to write its SIGNATURE on the earth pushing back the darkness of night. Imagine the ex-sumo wrestler&#039;s ( 曙 - あけぼの) face on the SUN writing his SIGNATURE all over the earth at<strong> DAWN</strong>.
