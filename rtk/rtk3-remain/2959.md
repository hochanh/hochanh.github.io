## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 16-2-2007(48): You wanna drive a<strong> Sanskrit ka</strong>? Just <em>add</em> it to the <em>road</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 11-3-2010(4): Ford didn&#039;t know what to call their next car, and it was ready to be released. A quick-witted Indian employee thought to himself, &quot;why don&#039;t they just call it the &#039;car&#039;, so they can get this show on the <em>road</em>?&quot; He raised his hand at the meeting and said, &quot;I propose we call it the Ford <strong>Ka</strong>. No, not like &#039;car&#039;, the<strong> Sanskrit ka</strong> invokes a sense of reliability, safety, performance and beauty. <em>Add</em> to that the fact that nobody will forget its name, because it&#039;s homophonous with the actual product!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kioku3">kioku3</a>] 24-9-2009(4): If you want to buy a<strong> Sanskrit ka</strong> (the top selling auto in India), you need to <em>add</em> a little bakeesh to the price for the salesman. Only then will you see yourself driving that<strong> Sanskrit ka</strong> down the <em>road</em>. (thanks mantixen).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SimHuman">SimHuman</a>] 17-3-2010(3): The<strong> Sanskrit ka</strong> just seems to be a high カロrie version of the katakana カ. Hit the road, you bloated phonetic character.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki">CasualTatsumaki</a>] 5-10-2010(1): 釈迦 [しゃか] Buddha. &quot;If you meet the Buddha on the <em>road</em>, kill him.&quot; An <em>ad(d)</em> for a car (Ka). This character is <em>add</em>ed to the word for Buddha.
