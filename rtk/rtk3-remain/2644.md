## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 15-10-2007(40): I see a panda wearing a<strong> backpack</strong>, and every so often something inside the<strong> backpack</strong> <em>reaches out</em> and grabs <em>bamboo</em>. (it’s acutally a baby panda reaching out to grab bamboo to eat).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 23-1-2009(3): With Kung Fu Panda being all the craze recently, I wasn&#039;t very surprised to see a schoolkid with a Kung Fu Panda<strong> backpack</strong>. But imagine my shock when he <em>reached out</em> into his<strong> backpack</strong> and pulled out some <em>bamboo</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 22-6-2007(1): When I encountered an ravenous <em>panda</em>, I just <em>reached back</em> to my<strong> backpack</strong> and pulled out two <em>bamboo</em> katanas.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lisbet">lisbet</a>] 21-10-2012(): People used to carry the bamboo they&#039;d cut in<strong> backpack</strong>s with straps they had to reach out and pull forward to hoist the bag up onto their backs.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki">CasualTatsumaki</a>] 24-1-2012(): My<strong> backpack</strong> is just <em>bamboo</em> slats so the homeless guy <em>reach out</em> and takes the can of coke from inside it.
