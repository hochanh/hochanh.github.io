## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 16-10-2008(30): The <em>state of mind</em> of a <em>younger brother</em> has<strong> respect for elders</strong>, including you if you&#039;re the elder brother.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 10-5-2008(17): Data, younger brother: Commander <em>Data</em> had a <em>younger, amoral brother</em> (Lore). When they visited an old computer museum, Lore remarked that he could compute much faster than the machines on exhibition. That&#039;s when Data found it to be his duty to teach his brother <strong>respect for elders</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 11-11-2008(11): The one family member who doesn&#039;t have<strong> respect for elders</strong> is the <em>younger brother</em>. In his immature <em>state of mind</em> he makes farting noises while playing with his food.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki">CasualTatsumaki</a>] 1-7-2010(1): Data&#039;s younger brother makes farting noises and has no<strong> respect for elders</strong> (thanks cameron_en).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 19-1-2009(1): Just picture the TIN MAN slapping the YOUNGER BROTHER (some stupid little munchkin) with an axe for not showing RESPECT FOR THE ELDERS (in this case, the Wizard of Oz).
