## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 18-1-2009(19): The<strong> heron</strong> <em>bird</em> took the <em>path</em> to heroin, regrettably.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 17-10-2007(10): As I was walking I noticed <strong>hair-on</strong> the <em>path</em>! When I bent to see what was up, I realized that they were in fact fine feathers poking through - someone had paved over a large <em>bird</em>!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 15-1-2010(7): You have to watch out for the<strong> HERON</strong>! When walking on a lakeshore PATH this BIRD will dive bomb you from behind. (View 鷺 as if your looking at it from above and the story works).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 18-7-2007(6): The<strong> heron</strong> is a <em>bird</em> large enough to walk on both <em>paths</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 22-7-2012(1): The<strong> heron</strong> is a <em>bird</em> with a lot of <strong>hair on</strong> it, so it leaves a <em>path</em> of hair in its wake and is therefore easy to track.
