## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/EusthEnoptEron">EusthEnoptEron</a>] 23-12-2008(23): The <em>bird</em> got tired of the <em>mountain</em> he lived on, so now he&#039;s flying away searching for an <strong>alternative<strong> island</strong></strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 14-6-2008(12): Mountain, bird: On the <strong>alternative<strong> island</strong></strong>, <em>birds</em> could just breed beside the <em>mountains</em> instead of upon one. The hippies didn&#039;t do any harm.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 2-8-2009(2): On an alternate type of<strong> island</strong>, a <em>bird</em> may roost beside the <em>mountain</em> rather than on it.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 20-3-2010(1): <strong>Islands alternate</strong> between those 島 with flightless <em>birds</em> (no aerodynamic <em>tail feathers</em>) and those 嶋 having <em>birds</em> with tail feathers (and the power of flight). The tail-less birds have migrated to the mountaintops to escape persecution from invaders (humans, cats etc.).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 7-3-2011(): The <em>bird</em> was going to land on the<strong> island</strong>, but then it saw the <em>mountain</em> was for <em>birds</em> into [alternate] music, so it swiftly pulled up its <em>tail feathers</em>.
