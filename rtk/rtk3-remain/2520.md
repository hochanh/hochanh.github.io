## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 14-6-2007(34): A<strong> downspout</strong> is made by hollowing out a <em>tree</em> and placing it to carry water &quot;<em>traffic</em>&quot; from your rooftop down to the ground.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 6-12-2009(14): My<strong> downspout</strong> empties into a <a href="../v4/2530.html">bucket</a> (#2530 桶) 桶 beside the <em>road</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 20-6-2007(6): You can&#039;t believe the <em>traffic</em> when climbing <em>trees</em>: why just the other day there was this massive<strong> downspout</strong> of leaves. It&#039;s really hard being a tree climber, harder than being a plumber, at any rate.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 31-12-2008(2): The Romans developed a system of <em>wooden</em> <strong>downspouts</strong> to drain water away from areas of heavy <em>traffic</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 20-11-2008(1): When there&#039;s a <em>traffic</em> jam, you can avoid the rush by using the<strong> downspout</strong>; a secret underground highway with a hidden entrance next to a big <em>tree</em>. Reminds me of that episode of the simpsons when homer joins the freemasons.
