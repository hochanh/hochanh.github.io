## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 27-6-2007(20): You see a <em>white dove</em> about to land in a <em>paddyfield</em>, and, believing that field to be under water, expect to hear a &quot;plop&quot;. But the plop doesn&#039;t come, so you think to yourself, &quot;Ah, that must be a<strong> dry field</strong>&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 14-8-2008(13): The<strong> dry field</strong> is the <em>rice field</em> that has dried up into <em>white</em> dust.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 31-7-2009(6): A <em>rice field</em> turns <em>white</em> as shit (literally) it is such a<strong> dry field</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 26-1-2011(1): That<strong> dry field</strong> was once a <em>white rice field</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sabretou">sabretou</a>] 13-4-2013(): The sun burned so bright that it looked straight <em>white</em>. Needless to say, the <em>field</em> below now was a<strong> dry field</strong>.
