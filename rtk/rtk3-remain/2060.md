## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 17-5-2008(61): This should be obvious, owners of prize race horse (STEEDS) are paid to have their<strong> STEED</strong> mate with another (hopefully to produce a prize winning foal). Yep, the<strong> STEED</strong>S are glorified HORSE HOOKERS.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 27-4-2008(22): Trojan horse, legal prostitute: The guy told the <em>legal prostitute</em> that he is like a <strong>steed</strong> in the bed and that she should do it for free. However, afterward - being severely disappointed- she considered him more like a <em>Trojan horse</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 13-7-2008(14): The <em>Trojan horse</em> approached a <em>legal prostitute</em>. &quot;What a fine<strong> steed</strong>!&quot;, she exclaimed. &quot;What I would not give to ride that animal!&quot; The men inside were thinking about what they would not give to ride that lady. At the end of the evening, all were satisfied and the lady had made a year&#039;s wages in a day.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 26-1-2008(6): The customer told the streetwalker that he was a real<strong> steed</strong> and he was going to work her over like a team of horses.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tryllid">tryllid</a>] 31-12-2010(3): Back when horses were called<strong> steed</strong>s, you just needed to own a <em>horse</em>, you didn&#039;t need a <em>license</em> to avoid using your <em>walking legs</em>.
