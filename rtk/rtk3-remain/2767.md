## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 2-11-2007(21): A<strong> javelin</strong> is a piece of <em>metal</em> used for <em>dispatching</em> enemies – or athletics judges if they’re not careful.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 18-1-2010(11): What was not reported in RtK1 is that it was with a<strong> javelin</strong> that finally they were able to 遣 <a href="../v4/1773.html">dispatch</a> (#1773 遣) the <em>conductor</em> who had dropped his baton as he ran down the <em>road</em> with that lady&#039;s <em>purse</em>. It was an amazing throw, from a remarkable distance, worthy of a <em>gold</em> medal if it had been the Olympics instead of a crime scene.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 16-2-2007(11): A<strong> javelin</strong> is a <em>metal</em> object you <em>dispatch</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 19-1-2009(3): I threw the <em>metal</em><strong> javelin</strong> so far it went right out the stadium and hit an innocent passerby. They had to <em>dispatch</em> the ambulance.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 5-3-2010(1): The FGM-148<strong> Javelin</strong> is an anti-tank missile that is used to <em>dispatch</em> large numbers of enemies at once. In games like Call of Duty 4, it&#039;s worth its weight in <em>gold</em>. <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AB">http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AB</a>:Javelin3.jpg.
