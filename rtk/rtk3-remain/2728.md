This student decided that the way to make things better was to put <em>ketchup</em> on them. Made carrots taste better, made annoying alarm clocks shut up, made ugly girls cry and run away. <em>Socrates</em> heard about this, and told him he should stop. The student said no, this was the only way to make things agreeable for him. &quot;Then maybe you should put ketchup on me,&quot; he said. The student saw the error of his ways.
