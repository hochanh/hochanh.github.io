## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adrianbarritt">adrianbarritt</a>] 14-1-2008(33): Quiet!!!! The <em>city walls</em> have <em>ears</em> he exclaimed.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjiknight">kanjiknight</a>] 12-1-2010(14): The <em>city walls</em> have <em>ears</em>!? Did you say that with an<strong> exclamation</strong> or <strong>question mark</strong>?

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 4-12-2008(5): This really means &quot;question mark&quot; so I assume Heisig was referring to an<strong> exclamation</strong> mark rather than some sort of verbal outburst. The RTKIII keywords are truly atrocious...I sort of picture the primitive on the right as resembling a question mark, so the kanji looks to me like a cartoonish ear straining to listen with a question mark next to it.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-7-2009(3): Spies press their <em>ears</em> against the <em>city walls</em> hoping to hear something audible, like an<strong> exclamation</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 25-10-2010(2): 耶蘇 , 耶蘇基督 , <a href="midori://search?text=摩耶＊">摩耶＊</a> , 耶嬢 <a href="../v4/2680.html">exclamation</a> (#2680 耶) ヤ ... Parts: 耳 , .阝 ... Note: <strong>Phonetic Ya</strong>. ... Story: <strong>Phonetic YA</strong> is an<strong> Exclamation</strong>. and an interesting name. And you can yell it as loud as you like because Mr. Burns has lost most of the use of his Ears. In fact a conversation with <em>Mr Burns</em> is likely to consist of him cupping his <em>Ear</em> and you <strong>Exclaiming</strong> as loud as you can. So sing Hey Ya! as loud as you want.
