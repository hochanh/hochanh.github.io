## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(47): Like the fruit itself,<strong> banana</strong> <em>flowers</em> look <em>charred</em> as they age.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/woelpad">woelpad</a>] 18-4-2008(10): <em>Charred</em><strong> banana</strong>s on a bed of <em>flowers</em> are a delicacy that stir up images of a tropic island.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 7-3-2007(5): <strong>Banana</strong> <em>flowers</em> look often <em>charred</em>, just like<strong> banana</strong>s often grow black very quickly.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 30-10-2010(3): Perfect. This is a Hawaiian Luau. You cook meat by building a fire, putting food wrapped in<strong> banana</strong> leaves in, and then burying the whole thing with sand. The person here has their own original recipe. They use Turkey instead of the traditional pork and put<strong> banana</strong> flowers on top. The fire is underneath the turkey.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 5-11-2010(1): 芭蕉 , 蕉風俳諧 , 甘蕉 , <a href="../v4/2367.html">banana</a> (#2367 蕉) ショウ( 焦 ) ... Parts: 艹, 焦 <a href="../v4/557.html">char</a> (#557 焦) ... Note: For both 芭 <a href="../v4/2386.html">plantain</a> (#2386 芭) or 蕉 <a href="../v4/2367.html">banana</a> (#2367 蕉). IRL meaning: the name 芭蕉 , Basho, the famous J Poet &#039;inventor&#039; of the Haiku. ... A Haiku in his memory: ... Basho<strong> banana</strong>?- A Charred flower last name- it is such a shame. (it helps me to think of the End of the<strong> Banana</strong> looking charred, and the is the end Kanji of Basho.).
