## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 11-1-2009(29): (thx Katsuo) The so-called &#039;mighty&#039; <strong>Qin dynasty</strong> died a nasty death from starvation because they focused on growing <em>bonsai</em> instead of <em>wheat</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 18-8-2008(19): What did man chew in the<strong> Manchu dynasty</strong>? Well, first man chew <em>bonsai</em>, but he find that rather tough, so next man chew <em>wheat</em>. EDIT: I think the keyword should really be <strong>Qin dynasty</strong>. So how a about new story based on Bob Dylan&#039;s song &quot;Mighty Quinn&quot;: &quot;<em>Bonsai</em> without, <em>wheat</em> plants within, you&#039;ll not grow nothing like the mighty <strong>Qin</strong>. (dynasty).&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 9-3-2010(14): Please note: this is a mistake in Heisig. This kanji does not refer to the<strong> Manchu dynasty</strong>, also known as the Qing dynasty, 1644-1911CE, the last ruling dynasty of China. Instead, it is used for the similarly-named Qin dynasty, which was the first dynasty of imperial China. Story: The <strong>Qin Dynasty</strong> of 221-206BCE laid the foundations for the golden age of Chinese development. Two agricultural innovations they implemented were the art of topiary (exemplified by the bonsai) and crop cultivation (wheat).

Both シン ... Story: Qin( 秦 ) short dynasty that lasted only a few years longer than China&#039;s first emperor. It got <em>two (three?)</em> <em>big</em> for its <em>Wheat</em> supply, since the massive public works projects starved the population into revolt. But enabled the Han to rule for 300 years.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869">perrin4869</a>] 3-9-2011(): The dragon in the <strong>Manchu dynasty&#039;s</strong> flag giving its <em>bonsai</em> some tasty <em>wheat</em>.
