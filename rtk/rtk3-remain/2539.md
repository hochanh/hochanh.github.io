## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 24-5-2008(43): Fire, voiced - water: After the incident where the insect made a pitiful <em>voiced</em> sound, you decide to free it. Immediately it is attracted to the<strong> candlelight</strong> and flies into the <em>fire</em>. Bugger!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 21-11-2008(6): You were watching the poor insect bound up <em>voicing</em> &quot;Help me! Help me!&quot; (<a href="../v4/835.html">voiced</a> (#835 濁)), so you answered his calls for help by using a<strong> candlelight</strong> to set the evil spider on <em>fire</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 23-12-2009(4): Drawn to the<strong> CANDLELIGHT</strong> by the allure of the FIRE, the moth momentarily VOICED it&#039;s demise because there wasn&#039;t any water to put it out.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 25-6-2007(2): In order to get that <em>insect</em> out of your throat (continuing from <a href="../v4/835.html">voiced</a> (#835 濁), you use the <em>fire</em> of a<strong> candlelight</strong> to scare the bugger.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 2-4-2009(1): I go round with a <strong>candle(light)</strong> setting <em>fire</em> to all the <em>spiders</em>. (Notes: 1. Let right side = &quot;spider&quot; because a <em>spider</em> makes a <em>net</em> to <em>bind up insects</em>; 2. net = 罒 horizontal eye).
