## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 27-7-2009(40): I use<strong> balancing scales</strong> to make sure everyone gets an <em>even</em> amount of <em>Wheaties</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 21-2-2010(7): Before the technology of<strong> balancing scales</strong> was widely available, farmers used to sell their <em>wheat</em> grain using the following method: customers would visit, and shovel as much <em>wheat</em> grain as they could onto a giant <em>lilypad</em>. They were allowed as much as they could pile on, and they were charged according to the number of <em>lilypads</em> they filled. This ensured that the greedy were punished, because if the lilypad sunk under the weight, they were still charged for the grain.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 31-3-2007(5): He didn&#039;t have a<strong> balancing scales</strong> to figure out how much his <em>wheat</em> weighed, but he came up with a solution: he loaded a vessel with wheat and let it float in his <em>lily pond</em>, and then he measured how deep the vessel would be in the water.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 5-6-2009(1): Picture weighing wheat on a lilly.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 4-8-2008(1): This is the set of<strong> balancing scales</strong> that they use to figure out how much <em>Cap &#039;n Crunch</em> to put into each box. They have a control weight off in the distance (you can&#039;t see it), and then a small <em>lily pad</em>. They pour an appropriate amount of <em>Cap &#039;n Crunch</em> onto the <em>lily pad</em>, and just before it starts to sink below water level, they know that&#039;s the proper amount.
