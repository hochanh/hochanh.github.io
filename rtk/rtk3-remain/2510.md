3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paasan">paasan</a>] 20-7-2010(4): While the other obvious stories (three currently) surely does the trick, I cannot help myself being perverted as usual. You guys ever played the &#039;<strong>wooden ladle</strong>&#039; game? Probably you have but used a teddy bear instead. Anyhow, teddies are rare in Japan so they used<strong> wooden ladle</strong> instead. A group of guys pulls out their <em>wood</em> and last one to do it into the <em>ladle</em> gets to drink it all. How&#039;s that sauce coming along? ごめん.
