## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 14-11-2007(60): Tip: Learn &quot;this&quot; 斯 and &quot;that&quot; 其 at the same time.

Stories:<strong> This</strong> <em>bushel basket</em> comes with an <em>axe</em> to open it, but <strong>that</strong> one doesn&#039;t.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/enryu">enryu</a>] 4-9-2009(9): (Thx Kats)<strong> THIS</strong> AXE can beat any CHESS peice... except for maybe THAT ROOK.
