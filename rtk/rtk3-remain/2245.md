## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adrianbarritt">adrianbarritt</a>] 29-12-2007(65): If you<strong> bump into</strong> a <em>juvenile</em> he is bound to give you the <em>finger</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 29-7-2009(5): <em>Juveniles</em> are often unsure of how long their extremities actually are, because they&#039;re growing all the time. They often<strong> bump into</strong> things because their <em>fingers</em> are a centimetre or two longer than the last time they looked!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-10-2008(5): The <em>finger</em> of the <em>juvenile</em> <strong>bumps into</strong> you, but he actually tried to give you a kancho.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 24-12-2007(5): Puberty is an interesting time for <em>juveniles</em>. They get their <em>fingers</em> out ready to &quot;accidentally&quot;<strong> bump into</strong> each other (usually of the other gender, but that&#039;s a personal thing).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 25-8-2006(2): <em>Juveniles</em> are well known to have not entirely well coordinated bodies, so they<strong> bump into</strong> anything, and use their <em>fingers</em> to steady themselves. Meaning of course that they&#039;ll break precious things right and left.
