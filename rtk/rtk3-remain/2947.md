## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 16-2-2007(21): A <em>rin</em> of a <em>meter</em> is a<strong> centimeter</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 30-4-2007(13): <strong>Centimeter</strong> is spelt the <em>American</em> way. As mantixen says, it is a <em>rin</em> of a meter.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 10-7-2009(5): A<strong> centimeter</strong> is as long as a piece of <em>rice</em>, which is oddly enough worth about a <em>rin</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 11-3-2010(2): One meaning of <a href="../v4/178.html">rin</a> (#178 厘) is &quot;one-hundredth&quot;, but if you&#039;re thinking of the old coin, the hole in a <em>rin</em> coin was one <strong>centimetre</strong> in dia<strong>me</strong>ter.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 4-6-2009(2): Remember? You threw the computer off the cliff and it was worth a <em>rin</em>! The size has reduced, too. The smallest pieces are about as big as a grain of <em>rice</em>, the biggest pieces are some<strong> centimeter</strong>s &quot;big&quot;.
