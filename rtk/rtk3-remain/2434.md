## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 7-1-2010(20): &quot;forgive&quot; is a better keyword for this. A woman forgives with her mouth, but it has to come from the heart.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 14-2-2007(15): He&#039;s very<strong> sensitive</strong> about that sculpture, as it captures the <em>likeness</em> of the woman of his <em>heart</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 7-6-2007(9): To tell if someone is<strong> sensitive</strong>, first make a <em>likeness</em> of their <em>heart</em>. Then observe them while you poke the heart, stick needles in it, etc. If the person reacts, then that means they are<strong> sensitive</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-7-2009(8): Be careful with a <em>woman</em>&#039;s <em>heart</em>, as well as her <em>opening</em>, because they&#039;re both very<strong> sensitive</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 11-1-2009(6): <em>Women</em> always <em>mouth</em> off about how insensitive men are to the needs of their <em>hearts</em>. Maybe the problem is that they&#039;re too <strong>sensitive</strong>!
