## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 29-7-2009(29): A <strong>scabbard</strong> is a <em>leather</em> sheath that should to <em>resemble</em> the blade it&#039;s going to hold.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 16-7-2007(15): Originally, the <em>leather</em><strong> saddle straps</strong> were for holding <em>candles</em>, but now they&#039;re more commonly used for holding swords, like <strong>scabbards</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 1-2-2011(6): It&#039;s all about the element of surprise. At the duel, I pull a <em>candle</em> out my <em>leather</em> <strong>scabbard</strong> and hurl it at my enemy to set him on fire. HA HA!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 6-9-2007(3): These<strong> saddle straps</strong> sure <em>resemble</em> <em>leather</em>, but <em>leather</em> cracks when dry. Instead, they are made of synthetic materials (to last longer).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 29-11-2008(2): These<strong> saddle straps</strong> are made of extremely durable <em>leather</em>, you can even try burning it with a <em>candle</em> and nothing will happen to it.
