## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 3-12-2008(37): <strong>Babble</strong> is what comes out of <em>Asian</em> people&#039;s <em>mouth</em>s until you learn their language.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 10-12-2006(12): The kanji has the meanings of &quot;mute&quot; ( 聾唖 ) and &quot;speechless&quot; ( 唖然 ), like &quot;dumb&quot; used to (&quot;struck dumb&quot; etc). Asian mouth is mute in a way, because they don&#039;t<strong> babble</strong> so much as they do in some parts of the world.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 15-11-2010(3): 唖然 , 聾唖 , 唖者 , 聾唖者 , 唖 , <a href="../v4/2958.html">babble</a> (#2958 唖) ア, おし ... Parts: 口 , 亜 <a href="../v4/1809.html">Asia</a> (#1809 亜) ... Note: Odd Keyword. Really <strong>Mute, and Phonetic for ア</strong>. 亜 used to be ア phonetic, but as 亜細亜 (アジア) came to be a common term, 亜 came to used as a symbol for Asia, like 米 for America, 仏 for France, 阿 for Africa, 独 for Germany, etc. ... Similars: 喋る <a href="../v4/2158.html">chatter</a> (#2158 喋), 唖然 <a href="../v4/2958.html">babble</a> (#2958 唖) ... Story: Am I running my <em>mouth</em> about things to do with <em>Asia</em>? Am I <strong>Babbling</strong>?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 12-6-2008(2): Mouth, Asia: The baby opened its <em>mouth</em> and started <strong>babbling</strong>. To me, it was as intelligible as an <em>Asian</em> language, but the parents were <strong>babbling</strong> back in the same language.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 16-2-2007(1): At first, an <em>Asian mouth</em> might sound like<strong> babble</strong>.
