## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 29-5-2007(19): There are two methods for swimming up on your enemy unnoticed. A ninja using a<strong> grassy reed</strong>, making sure the <em>flower</em> is first removed, will approach stealthily. A warriors scabbard, once the <em>halberd</em> is removed, can also substitute for a breathing tube in a pinch.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 30-6-2010(12): <strong>Grassy reed</strong>s are <em>plants</em> useful for thatching. Be careful though, the leaf tips can be as sharp as a <em>halberd</em>. Careful with <a href="../v4/242.html">reed</a> (#242 荻), <a href="../v4/2364.html">hollow reed</a> (#2364 芦) and <a href="../v4/2411.html">ditch reed</a> (#2411 葦).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 29-7-2008(6): The <em>knight</em> can&#039;t stand the<strong> grassy reed</strong> plants that are constantly invading his garden. I mean, they look nice in nature and everything, but they do not belong in his <em>flower</em> bed! If you&#039;ve ever tried to pull them, though, you know that it&#039;s pretty tough to grasp them - generally you only get the &quot;hairy&quot; <em>flower</em> part on top and leave the actual stem. No worries - he gets his huge <em>halberd</em> and just lays waste to his whole garden - <em>flowers</em>, <strong>grassy reeds</strong>, and all.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 15-11-2008(2): As I looked closer into the<strong> grassy reed</strong>s, I noticed that the <em>flower</em> was actually a blood-stained <em>halberd</em>... ahh!!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 6-9-2006(2): He adorned his <em>halberd</em> with <em>flowers</em> from<strong> grassy reed</strong>s. Probably some superstition.
