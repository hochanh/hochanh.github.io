## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/billyclyde">billyclyde</a>] 1-11-2007(33): The SICKNESS called<strong> cancer</strong> works by self-replication, so that its bad GOODS grow more &amp; more until a vertiable MOUNTAIN of them forms on you-- that&#039;s the tumor, the awful sign of<strong> cancer</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 6-9-2009(8): This is people <em>sick</em> with<strong> cancer</strong> seeking alternative treatment from <em>goods</em> of dubious repute at a remote <em>mountain</em> clinic.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 27-7-2009(6): The only cure for the <em>sickness</em> they call<strong> cancer</strong> is a <em>good</em> they sell at the top of that <em>mountain</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 21-11-2008(4): People who are <em>sick</em> with <em>cancer</em> will buy <em>mountains of goods</em> (medicines, fake cures/placebos) in order to try and cure themselves.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 18-2-2010(3): When the human race lived as <em>cavemen</em>, our lives were simpler: we didn&#039;t eat processed, packaged <em>goods</em>, we just ate fresh, natural food and breathed the clean <em>mountain</em> air, and we had much lower rates of<strong> cancer</strong> compared with today.
