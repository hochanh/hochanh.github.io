## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 15-8-2008(24): This is actually the old<strong> ten thousand</strong> yen bill in Japan - <em>Jiminy Cricket</em> surrounded by a wreath of flowers. It&#039;s pretty uncommon to see nowadays since it was only in print for a few days immediately after the war (MacArthur wanted a way to make sure that even the rich kept their atrocities in their consciences).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cb4960">cb4960</a>] 16-2-2009(12): Your <em>flowers</em> will not be safe if <strong>ten thousand [old]</strong> <em>Jiminy Crickets</em> come to town.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 24-5-2009(5): The <strong>old<strong> ten thousand</strong></strong> Yen bill showed a <em>long tailed monkey</em> 禺 with a <em>flower</em> on his head. It was the pet of the emperor.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 2-8-2009(3): A man in a <em>straitjacket</em> counts out<strong> ten thousand</strong> [old] <em>flowers</em> for his imaginary girlfriend.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 26-10-2010(2): 壱萬 =一万, 都萬神社 , <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/2969">ten thousand [old]</a> (#2969 萬) マン, よろず ... Parts:艹, 禺 ... Story: <em>Vern/Jiminy Cricket</em> has a bad <em>Rose</em> allergy: &quot;I am really <strong>Itchy Man</strong>&quot; he says. I tell him that is a really old joke, and he should stop.
