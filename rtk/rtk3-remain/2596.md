## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 1-11-2007(36): Some<strong> mill</strong>s use an animal, typically an ox or donkey, to rotate the stone. But in this<strong> mill</strong> the <em>stone</em> is being pulled round by a <em>turkey</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 8-11-2006(5): I can tell you, it was a big mess when a <em>turkey</em> accidentally came between the <em>stones</em> of the wind<strong> mill</strong>. We had to clean the blood and feathers away for ages.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 21-11-2008(3): To create <em>turkey</em> stock, you&#039;ll need to grind the turkey down using a <em>stone</em><strong> mill</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 11-3-2010(2): <em>Stoned turkey</em>. We were <em>stone</em>d &amp;<strong> mill</strong>ing round the old<strong> mill</strong> when somehow he ended up snood-first through the<strong> mill</strong><em>stone</em>s. <em>Stoned turkey</em> = <em>stone-ground turkey</em> before you could say 八番目の死んだ七面鳥 .
