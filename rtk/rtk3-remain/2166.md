## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 16-3-2007(80): These &amp;^% <em>stamps</em> won&#039;t stay fixed to the envelop when I lick them with my <em>mouth</em>. No matter how hard I<strong> bash</strong> them, they come loose every time. Aargh!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 14-5-2009(28): For me, the kanji looks like a picture of two eyes. Somebody<strong> bash</strong>ed the right one until it burst open. Ugh... Put a stamp on it - I don&#039;t want to see it!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum">oregum</a>] 2-8-2010(14): The STAMP collector<strong> BASH</strong>ED me in the MOUTH for using his STAMPS on my letters.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 3-8-2010(5): It was an unlucky fate for <a href="../v4/1400.html">fate</a> (#1400 命) 命 to be<strong> bash</strong>ed in by the other kanji when it missed a kanji &#039;meeting&#039;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Machine_Gun_Cat">Machine_Gun_Cat</a>] 9-7-2009(3): Hey, if you<strong> bash</strong> somebody in the mouth and your wearing a ring it kinda leaves a stamp on their skin... Cool do it again, do it again.
