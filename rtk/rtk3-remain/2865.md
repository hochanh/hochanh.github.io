## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Crowfoot">Crowfoot</a>] 7-6-2008(27): Here we have two people sitting on chairs, trying to set up their camera on a<strong> tripod</strong> and periodically checking the viewfinder with their <em>eyes</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 13-5-2010(4): (NB: I use <strong>THREE-LEGGED KETTLE</strong> for 鼎 , and reserve <strong>TRIPOD</strong> for 鬲 <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/39730">Unicode-0x9b32</a> (#39730 鬲).) This <strong>THREE-LEGGED KETTLE</strong> is used for sacrificial incense-burning. 鼎 shows a watchful <em>EYE</em> carefully putting the offering material in the opening of the <strong>KETTLE</strong>, which is shown as being squarely supported <em>ON EACH SIDE</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 2-12-2008(3): <em>Eye</em> (I) really wanted a<strong> tripod</strong>, so I went into a camera store with <em>two pistols</em> and got everyone to <em>put their hands in the air</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 9-3-2010(2): For anyone who&#039;s read the series, to me this is a pictograph of one of John Christopher&#039;s<strong> Tripod</strong>s, with one large evil glowing <em>eye</em> and a mechanical skeleton around it. <a href="http://bit.ly/thetripods">http://bit.ly/thetripods</a>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 30-7-2009(1): Your <em>eye</em> looks through the viewfinder as a three-legged<strong> tripod</strong> supports your camera.
