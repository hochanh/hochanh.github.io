## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 10-5-2009(28): I have used <em>Red Bull</em> as a primitive since <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1438">furthermore/waver</a> (#1438 猶), so now it is easy to remember the<strong> chieftain</strong>&#039;s name: Chief Red Bull!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 31-7-2009(24): Only the<strong> chieftain</strong> could drink <em>horned whiskey</em> since he was the one responsible for procreation.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 3-1-2008(14): Tip to avoid confusing with 伯 <a href="../v4/967.html">chief</a> (#967 伯): the other has &quot;white&quot; but a &quot;chieftain&quot; is a &quot;tan chief,&quot; so this is the character without &quot;white&quot; in it.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 30-12-2008(5): The<strong> chieftain</strong> gets horny every time he has some whiskey.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NeoGlitch">NeoGlitch</a>] 25-11-2010(2): The<strong> chieftain</strong> is <a href="../v4/1439.html">revered</a> (#1439 尊) because he can drink <em>horned whiskey</em> with absolute ease.
