## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 25-11-2007(47): In the debate, your political opponent&#039;s has such a <strong>warped</strong> sense of perspective, that he believes the <em>negative</em> is actually <em>correct</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura">taikura</a>] 17-12-2008(7): <strong>Warped</strong> is a combination of <em>not</em> and <em>correct</em>. If a piece of wood is described as<strong> warped</strong>, that means it is <em>not</em> the <em>correct</em> shape, according to a particular standard we have in mind. The <em>correct</em> Kanji points us to the standard; while the <em>not</em> or <em>un-</em> Kanji denotes that the standard is not met. Hence, whatever we are talking about is not standard - i.e. it is <em>not correct</em> or <em>not regular</em>. In other words, it is<strong> warped</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 30-7-2009(4): On standardized tests they use <em>negative</em> questions that are so<strong> warped</strong> you don&#039;t know which answer is <em>correct</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cb4960">cb4960</a>] 16-2-2009(4): A <strong>warped</strong> person will often believe that <em>negative</em> actions are the most <em>correct</em> for any given situation.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki">CasualTatsumaki</a>] 25-3-2010(3): This kanji ひずみ is also used for guitar distortion.
