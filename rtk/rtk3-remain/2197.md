## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christoph">Christoph</a>] 21-11-2007(27): When asking a <em>girl</em> out on a date, you are only <strong>well finished</strong> when you have her <em>address</em> and phone number.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 15-3-2007(24): To become<strong> well finished</strong>, young <em>women</em> often go to a finishing school at a posh <em>address</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 8-6-2009(10): The proof that your pick-up line was<strong> well finished</strong> is that you got the <em>woman&#039;s address</em>!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki">CasualTatsumaki</a>] 1-4-2011(7): <strong>Euphemism</strong> is this kanji&#039;s most common usage. Story: A <em>woman</em> whose <em>address</em> is in a red light district uses <strong>euphemisms</strong> to describe where she lives. 婉曲 [えんきょく] euphemistic; circumlocution; roundabout; indirect; 優婉 [ゆうえん] elegant; grand.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 2-12-2010(4): 婉曲 , 婉曲法 , 婉美 =艶美, 優婉 <a href="../v4/2197.html">well finished</a> (#2197 婉) エン( 宛 ) ... Parts: 女 , 宛 <a href="../v4/1417.html">address</a> (#1417 宛) (cf: 腕 <a href="../v4/1418.html">arm</a> (#1418 腕), 茶碗 <a href="../v4/2591.html">teacup</a> (#2591 碗), 椀 <a href="../v4/2487.html">wooden bowl</a> (#2487 椀)） ... Story: Since the most common non-name usage is <strong>Euphemism</strong> ( 婉曲 ), then a play on the idea is apt: Saying a &#039;<em>Woman</em> uses her <em>Arm</em> ( 腕 ) well&#039; is <strong>Euphemistically</strong> saying she gives a good hand job, which is <strong>Euphemistically</strong> called a &#039;happy ending&#039;, which is a <strong>Well Finished</strong> massage.
