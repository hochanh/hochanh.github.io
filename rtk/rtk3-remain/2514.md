## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 19-1-2007(21): A Japanese<strong> hackberry</strong> <em>tree</em> is a type of tree that only has full foliage in the <em>summer</em>. It loses its foliage in the winter.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 20-11-2008(18): If you hack into the<strong> hackberry</strong> <em>tree</em> with ur PC, you can program it to grow berries even in <em>summer</em>. What a cool hack!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 1-12-2009(9): I threw my blackberry against a<strong> hackberry</strong> tree. It is the summer of the iPhone!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wilsoncb">wilsoncb</a>] 26-8-2010(8): If you hack into the<strong> hackberry</strong> tree, you can program it to think it&#039;s always summer, so that it never stops producing berries! Awesome!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 29-6-2010(6): In case anyone finds this interesting, we&#039;ve now had the trees for three seasons: Winter ( 柊 ), Spring ( 椿 ), and Summer ( 榎 ). What&#039;s the Autumn (楸) tree? Well, it&#039;s another way to write 梓 <a href="../v4/1498.html">catalpa</a> (#1498 梓), albeit with a different reading (キササゲ vs アズサ). <a href="../v4/1498.html">catalpa</a> (#1498 梓) also refers to the Japanese cherry birch, whereas 楸 exclusively means the catalpa. キササゲ can also be written with the ateji 木豇豆 or 木大角豆 .
