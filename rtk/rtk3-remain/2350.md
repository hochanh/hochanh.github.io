## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 31-8-2006(37): The<strong> strawberry</strong> plant is one that <em>mothers</em> really like. Not particularly for its <em>flowers</em>, but for the fruit of course, so they can make fresh<strong> strawberry</strong> pies.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 2-4-2009(15): Most people eat the fruit of the<strong> strawberry</strong> plant, but your <em>mother</em> eats the <em>flowers</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/billybob300c">billybob300c</a>] 28-8-2010(5): Flowers over breasts...look like strawberries!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 14-12-2008(5): One of my earliest memories is <em>mom&#039;s</em><strong> strawberry</strong> nipples under a <em>flowery</em> shirt.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django">Django</a>] 31-12-2009(3): There was once a porn star called いちご　みるく (if you&#039;re over 18 feel free to google her). She was best known for <em>mother roles</em>, where she&#039;d surprise her son&#039;s best friend by walking in wearing but a garland of <em>flowers</em> and with her<strong> strawberry</strong> <em>nipples</em> (the two drops, which helps me to remember that this frame does not use the abbreviated version of the mama kanji) on show...
