## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 29-5-2008(33): Spiderman, half: Since only <em>half</em> of his family was left (aunt May, uncle died), <em>Spiderman</em> kept strong<strong> ties</strong> with her.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 21-4-2008(10): I must buy some more<strong> ties</strong> – <em>half</em> of mine are in <em>threads</em>. (Edit: All the kanji dictionaries I have checked classify this character as <em>thread + half</em>. Depending on the font, though, the right side often appears as a variant of 半 with the top two strokes sloping outwards).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 2-1-2010(6): Spiderman&#039;s family<strong> ties</strong> are half man, half spider.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 7-3-2010(5): <em>Spiderman</em> is remarkable in that <em>half</em> his family<strong> ties</strong> are not human. This other half is a somewhat &quot;small half&quot; indicated by the 小 -like element on top of 半 .

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 20-5-2009(4): What about <strong>wrong half</strong> as primitive meaning for the strange &quot;half&quot; we have here? So who is <em>Spiderman</em>&#039;s <em>wrong half</em>? I think his his former &quot;best friend&quot;: He turned out to be the son of his worst enemy! What once was friendship almost as close as family<strong> ties</strong> turned to fierce hostility...
