## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 14-1-2008(36): The <em>cow</em> in this frame 牝 is filling a <em>spoon</em> with milk from its udders, so it must be a<strong> female animal</strong>. (The <em>cow</em> in the next frame 牡 is rolling around in the <em>soil</em> and is, not surprisingly, a <strong>male animal</strong>.).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 21-11-2008(12): While the bull wants rough sex, the <em>cow</em> would rather <em>spoon</em>, I guess all<strong> female animal</strong>s are the same.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 27-7-2009(7): <em>Cow</em>s that give milk for your cereal <em>spoon</em> are<strong> female animal</strong>s.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 18-9-2010(3): A <em>cow</em> is a<strong> female animal</strong> that fills your <em>spoon</em> with ice cream, milk, yogurt, etc.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 17-2-2010(3): You have to <em>sit down</em> beside a <em>cow</em> to milk it. Make sure it&#039;s a<strong> female animal</strong> though - a male may let you do the same thing, but you sure don&#039;t want to drink the milk.
