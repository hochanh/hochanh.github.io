## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 30-7-2009(21): A <em>bird</em> that goes to the inland <em>wards</em> for food is the<strong> seagull</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 8-3-2010(7): There&#039;s a new <em>Xbox</em> game called Extreme <em>Bird</em> Chase, where you chase flocks of <strong>seagulls</strong> on the beach. Soon we truly will never need to leave the house.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/EusthEnoptEron">EusthEnoptEron</a>] 21-12-2008(5): <em>Wolverine</em> had enough of this <em>ward</em> and hence went to the seaside with his <em>cardboard box</em>. Now he always kills a <em>bird</em>, a<strong> seagull</strong>, when he wakes up and eats it for breakfast, while listening to the sound of the sea.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paasan">paasan</a>] 28-7-2010(2): Everybody hates <strong>seagulls</strong>, even Grim Reaper. Here we see <em>Grim Reaper</em> hiding in a <em>cardboard box</em> so that annoying <em>bird</em> wont poo on him too.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 4-12-2009(2): In Minato <em>ku</em> the<strong> seagull</strong>s are the <em>bird</em>s that may be found on the East side (i.e., right side, for placement of the primitive). Some of them, I&#039;m told, are plotting an 殴 <a href="../v4/1698.html">assault</a> (#1698 殴) on 欧 <a href="../v4/1699.html">Europe</a> (#1699 欧). On the West side one is more likely to find a 躯 <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/2986">body [old]</a> (#2986 躯), like the one last week, done in by a 枢 <a href="../v4/1697.html">hinge</a> (#1697 枢) gun in a 駆 <a href="../v4/1983.html">drive</a> (#1983 駆)-by shooting.
