## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 21-5-2007(65): The greatest<strong> fabrication</strong> ever told was that God made the <em>water </em> and the <em>earth</em> in only one <em>day</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 6-6-2009(20): This kanji should mean <strong>black soil</strong>. It is is used for Buddha&#039;s death and nirvana ( 涅槃 (ねはん)). Story:<strong> Fabrication</strong> of black soil. Use <em>water</em> to wash away other colours and and dry it in the <em>sun</em> (<em>sun</em> over <em>soil</em>).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kumakuma">kumakuma</a>] 20-11-2008(9): It is a<strong> fabrication</strong> that god made WATER, SUN and EARTH. It was already there when he came. (thx to ikmys!).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/spleenlol">spleenlol</a>] 23-7-2010(4): The <em>soil</em> will turn into <strong>black soil</strong> after you pour <em>water</em> on it and it sits all <em>day</em> under the <em>sun</em>. This kanji means <strong>black soil</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nesert">nesert</a>] 2-3-2012(1): <strong>Black soil</strong> is nirvana for plants. Just add some <em>water</em> and <em>sun</em> to the <em>soil</em> and you&#039;re all set.
