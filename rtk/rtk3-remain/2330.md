## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 29-11-2012(45): If you get caught in an<strong> eddy</strong>, the <em>water</em> seems <em>determined</em> to pull you in. (Edit: As Sam79&#039;s post says, &quot;eddy&quot; isn&#039;t a good keyword. This kanji refers to things that stop moving such as water, air, speech, etc. &quot;Stagnate&quot; has been used elsewhere, so maybe &quot;go stale,&quot; &quot;stall,&quot; or &quot;stop moving&quot; would be suitable keywords. Story: The <em>water</em> reaches a <em>determined</em> position and <strong>stops moving</strong>).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 24-7-2009(15): An<strong> eddy</strong> is created when <em>water</em> <em>determines</em> it doesn&#039;t want to just &quot;go with the flow&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Sam79">Sam79</a>] 8-3-2012(4): Watch out, I think the keyword gets it wrong - at least I picture something dynamic for<strong> eddy</strong> - but all the meanings in the dictionary suggest stagnation, dead water and the like. That makes sense ethymologically, we have water that is determined - not do do anything to you, but in the sense that it&#039;s situation and location is fixed.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 27-9-2006(2): The <em>water determined</em> itself in the shape of an<strong> eddy</strong>, and we were all drawn towards the center of it!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sabretou">sabretou</a>] 21-4-2013(1): <strong>Eddy</strong> is <em>determined</em> to sail through the <em>waters</em> of an<strong> eddy</strong> even though he&#039;s been told it&#039;s futile.
