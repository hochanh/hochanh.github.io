## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(47): The<strong> sacred Shinto tree</strong> is a <em>tree</em> of the <em>gods</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 14-3-2010(14): This kanji is a 国字 (こくじ) i.e. created in Japan. Logically it combines <em>tree</em> 木 + <em>gods</em> 神 giving us a &quot;tree of the gods&quot; (<strong>sacred Shinto tree</strong>). Note: 榊 (さかき) has 2 variants where middle element is either 礻or 示 .

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 28-12-2006(5): The<strong> sacred Shinto tree</strong> is of course a <em>tree</em> that is dedicated to the <em>gods</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hirata">hirata</a>] 4-2-2013(): Sakaki agrees to go on a date with you, so the both of you visit a shrine. She spends the entire time staring at the<strong> sacred Shinto tree</strong>, quietly making a prayer to the gods. Maybe you should have picked a better place! (The Sakaki here is from Azumanga Daioh, and her name uses the same Kanji.).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Haych">Haych</a>] 6-11-2012(): I&#039;m imagining the<strong> sacred shinto tree</strong> as a <em>tree</em> that they use to communicate with the <em>gods</em> like the Godswood in game of thrones.
