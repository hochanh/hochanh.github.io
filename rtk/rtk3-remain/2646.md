## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 17-7-2007(41): <strong>Should</strong> you put <em>bamboo</em> through your <em>tongue</em>? If you don&#039;t already know the answer yourself, you <strong>shouldn&#039;t</strong> even ask.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 8-8-2009(17): Note: Mantixen has the right idea with his story. This<strong> should</strong> is not a moral obligation (eg, something you &quot;should&quot; do), but rather something that is expected (eg, my keys &quot;should&quot; be around here somewhere...). If you know some intermediate Japanese grammar, you&#039;ll be familiar with it as <strong>はず</strong>. Story: <a href="midori://search?text=「私の舌は竹から作られているよ！」「そんな">「私の舌は竹から作られているよ！」「そんな</a> <strong>はず</strong>ないでしょう！｣.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 28-7-2009(10): A <em>bamboo</em> <em>tongue</em> piercing<strong> should</strong> feel good, but I&#039;d rather she took it out first.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 29-6-2007(5): In some tribes, it is fully expected that you<strong> should</strong> put <em>bamboo</em> through your <em>tongue</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 8-9-2009(2): Tough without the puns available in the imaginative universe of <strong>はず</strong>. How to reach <em>bamboo tongue</em> from<strong> should</strong>? Well,<strong> should</strong> rhymes with &#039;wood&#039;. By a slip of the imaginative <em>tongue</em> you confuse wood &amp; <em>bamboo</em> &amp; write 木舌 instead of 筈 . You<strong> should</strong> know better! You<strong> should</strong> learn the bloody language instead of horsing around with this mnemonic crap! You<strong> should</strong> know <strong>はず</strong> by itself! You<strong> should</strong> not equate bamboo tongues with verbal auxiliaries! Ooh, hey, <em>tongue</em> and &#039;verbal&#039;! There&#039;s a start!
