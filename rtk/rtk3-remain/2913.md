## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 19-1-2009(26): When she&#039;s playing the<strong> lute</strong> between your two balls Japanese censors mosaic it out.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 8-6-2008(12): Two kings, mosaic: The contest of the <em>two kings</em> continued, but now they were to play the<strong> lute</strong>. However, their<strong> lute</strong> playing was so bad, the precious <em>mosaics</em> fell down the walls.. and were looted by the crowd.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kumakuma">kumakuma</a>] 19-1-2009(3): The<strong> lute</strong> is a good name for the thing between your TWO JEWELS, which is often behind a pixel MOSAIC on film.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 15-8-2008(3): The ancient tradition of producing <strong>lute</strong>s has been lost, but fortunately there&#039;s now a new<strong> lute</strong> synthesizer out. It&#039;s a <em>Rubik&#039;s Cube</em> made out of two colors of <em>gems</em>. You rotate the blocks to make different sounds. This may sound difficult, but hey, if you think about how hard it was to play the actual ancient<strong> lute</strong> itself, it&#039;s actually not bad at all.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 16-10-2010(2): 琵琶湖 , 琵琶市 , <a href="../v4/2913.html">lute</a> (#2913 琶) わ ...

Note :This is <em>only</em> used for the 2nd kanji for Biwa, and place names like Lake Biwa. Double King is a <em>Harp Primitive</em> of sorts, it seems ... Story:You want me to remember a kanji for <strong>Lute</strong>? <em>Wha&#039;???</em> (reading). <strong>2nd character for <em>Biwa</em></strong>, not <strong>lute</strong>, aka it is the <em>Fertilizer ( 巴 )</em> end of <em>Biwa</em>.
