## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 28-7-2009(23): <em>Spider-Man</em>&#039;s <em>religion</em> is a<strong> synthesis</strong> of spirituality and scientific proof.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 29-5-2008(13): Spiderman, religion: <em>Spiderman</em> discovered that the Scientology <em>religion</em> (which just opened a chapterhouse in his city) was a<strong> synthesis</strong> of idiotic believes and a little mystery. Everything to obtain large sums of money from its &#039;believers&#039;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 15-7-2010(5): A few nerds created a<strong> synthesis</strong> of <em>Spiderman</em> and <em>religion</em> called the Church of Spiderman, but none of the other nerds wanted to join because they were content with their Jedi faith.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 3-3-2010(5): <em>Spiderman</em> created his own <em>religion</em>, called The Church of Arachnology. Critics say it&#039;s nothing but a <strong>syncretic</strong> <em>religion</em>, a<strong> synthesis</strong> of fantasy and existing <em>religions</em>, with a dash of mind control thrown in. [The idea of a &#039;syncretic religion&#039; helps me remember this keyword.].

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/enryu">enryu</a>] 1-9-2009(4): Spidermans religion is based on a<strong> synthesis</strong> of swinging buildings and kicking ass.
