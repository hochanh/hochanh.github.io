## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 16-2-2007(31): Your <em>body parts</em> will become <em>tall</em> if you apply a special<strong> ointment</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Crowfoot">Crowfoot</a>] 28-4-2008(5): I need a <em>tall outhouse</em> so that I can stretch out while rubbing the<strong> ointment</strong> all over my <em>body</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/woelpad">woelpad</a>] 19-8-2008(3): The <em>tall</em> Heisig swapped his hood for a <em>crown</em> before applying <strong>ointment</strong> on his <em>body parts</em> to make them smooth as <a href="../v4/1368.html">silk</a> (#1368 絹).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ghinzdra">ghinzdra</a>] 5-10-2009(2): For LOR fans : actually rather than a drink Ents use an<strong> ointment</strong> . Obviously as they have no FLESH they never noticed any side-effect . In the other hand our 2 hobbits grew TALL in a short time . About the height where the CROWN of king elessar/aragorn sits on his head.
