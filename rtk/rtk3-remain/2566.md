## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 14-10-2007(42): He who possesses the<strong> crystal stone</strong> is the rightful <em>king</em> of <em>England</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 17-2-2010(1): After a successful sell-out concert tour around <em>England</em>, <em>Jewel</em> sat down with a pipe made out of some kind of<strong> crystal stone</strong> and began to take drugs to unwind, first getting <strong>stoned</strong> and then smoking <strong>crystal</strong> meth.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 4-8-2008(1): [+Aerin] Pretty much everything in <em>England</em> is fake. That includes the power of the <em>king</em> (it&#039;s a queen now, I know, but still) - everything is handled by the real government, and that post is just a symbol. Appropriately, then, the PM gets all the real diamonds, while the royalty gets the<strong> crystal stone</strong> decorated items.<strong> Crystal stone</strong>, of course, is just a nice way of saying rhinestones.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 2-2-2007(1): You can make fashionable <em>jewels</em> out of<strong> crystal stone</strong>. Of course they are also sold in <em>England</em>, London has a lot of jewellery shops.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 18-9-2010(): The<strong> crystal stone</strong> allowed Arthur to become the <em>king</em> of <em>England</em>.
