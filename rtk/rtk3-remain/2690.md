## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 9-2-2007(43): The<strong> octopus</strong> holds up two of his legs so that they look like antennas and then walks on the other six. He bears a strong <em>resemblance</em> to an <em>insect</em> when he does that.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kumakuma">kumakuma</a>] 1-12-2008(11): The octupus seduces the INSECTS with a CANDLE to eat them later.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 31-5-2008(7): Insect, candle: As <em>insects</em> are drawn to <em>candles</em>, so, also are deep sea divers drawn to the legend of the huge<strong> octopus</strong> living in the deep waters of the sea. (They also don&#039;t come back).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 23-2-2010(4): The<strong> octopus</strong> enjoys a <em>candle</em>lit dinner of fine, imported <em>insects</em> with a loved one. It holds all the silverware as well as its glasses of wine and water, all at the same time.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 28-7-2009(3): The<strong> octopus</strong> <em>resembles</em> an <em>insect</em> with its eight arms (not getting technical about how many legs an insect has).
