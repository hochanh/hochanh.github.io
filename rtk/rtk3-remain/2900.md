## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dilandau23">dilandau23</a>] 27-5-2007(37): Image: An Arctic explorer frozen<strong> within</strong> <em>ice</em>,<strong> within</strong> his hands are an <em>umbrella</em> and a <em>compass</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 2-12-2008(16): &quot;At&quot; seems like a better keyword for this one. You&#039;re freezing under your umbrella and using a compass to figure out where you&#039;re at.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 10-3-2010(1): The new iPhone will not only have a digital <em>compass</em><strong> within</strong> it, but also an <em>umbrella</em> that&#039;s strong enough to withstand blasting <em>ice</em> storms. All crammed<strong> within</strong> something that can fit in your front pocket.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 12-12-2009(1): The Sunday Naturalist meets the Scott expedition: <em>Ice</em><strong> within</strong> <em>compass</em> &amp; <em>umbrella</em>, both useless, both meaningless, freezing rain, soaked to frigid bone, numb<strong> within</strong> &amp; without, lost<strong> within</strong> fantasies of home,<strong> within</strong> a raw &amp; mordant sense of the fragility of life itself, without <em>direction</em>, but, oh, wait - what light doth yonder? -<strong> within</strong> 300 metres of a convenience store!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 31-7-2009(1): You stand<strong> within</strong> the safe area under an <em>umbrella</em> and use a <em>compass</em> to figure out where you&#039;re <strong>at</strong> in the <em>ice</em> of the tundra.
