## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-7-2009(29): <em>Orphans</em> sleep on the <em>flowers</em> of a<strong> rush mat</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kioku3">kioku3</a>] 30-7-2009(9): Rush Limbaugh criticized <em>orphans</em> and <em>flower</em> children on his show. So one group of <em>orphans</em> began selling &quot;<strong>Rush Mats</strong>&quot;--doormats with Rush Limbaugh&#039;s picture on them so people could wipe their feet on Rush&#039;s face before they went into the house. &quot;If our parents were still alive, they would be proud,&quot; the <em>orphans</em> said.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 13-10-2009(3): On my elegant<strong> rush mat</strong> I laid down <em>flowers</em> and an <em>orphan</em> named Lolita ..wait. what?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nadiatims">nadiatims</a>] 25-6-2009(3): The poor orphans took to injecting &#039;flowers&#039; (poppy variety), and lay Knocked Out (KO) on the<strong> rush mat</strong> floor of the orphanage.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 29-7-2008(3): You stop by a local marketplace and see that the <em>orphans</em> are selling <strong>rush mat</strong>s again. The <em>orphans</em> live out in the <em>flowers</em>, and as soon as the rushes flower (which is only one week out of the year), they grab them and weave mats. They are really nice - covered with <em>flowers</em> so they are soft to step on - and when you do step on them, there&#039;s none of that nasty rush smell - just the smell of sweet <em>baby melons</em>.
