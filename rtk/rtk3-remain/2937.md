## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 16-2-2007(39): This character would be the <em>sign of the snake</em> if the last stroke didn&#039;t<strong> stop short</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hknamida">hknamida</a>] 24-1-2008(5): A common <em>snake</em> strives to become a <em>sign of the snake</em>, but <strong>stops short</strong> and never reaches its goal. (Based on mantixen&#039;s story.).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki">CasualTatsumaki</a>] 18-11-2010(): For some reason, Orobus, the sign of the snake 巳 , always stops short of swallowing itself.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjiwarrior">kanjiwarrior</a>] 13-6-2009(): Igor (イ)&#039;s move to steal a snake&#039;s girl was to<strong> stop short</strong>. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxGRE2wpjsY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxGRE2wpjsY</a>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 27-10-2007(): You whack the cricket ball away, but surprisingly it <strong>stops short</strong> even before it reaches short stop. The reason is it hit a passing <em>snake</em> (and knocked a chunk out of him). Note: &quot;short stop&quot; is a fielding position in cricket.
