## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 15-5-2007(37): Before raging wildfires approach the town, homeowners will spray hose water on their roof to<strong> moisten</strong> the house as a preventative measure.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 2-1-2007(8): When it&#039;s very dry, I sometimes<strong> moisten</strong> the wooden beams on the <em>roof</em> with <em>water</em> so that they won&#039;t completely dry out and crack open.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 26-8-2010(6): Obviously, <em>water</em> on a <em>roof</em> will<strong> moisten</strong> it.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869">perrin4869</a>] 26-4-2011(2): Remember the person hanging for dear life in frame <a href="../v4/1059.html">grip</a> (#1059 握)? Well, someone spilled <em>water</em> on his hands, <strong>moistening</strong> them, making him lose his grip from the <em>roof</em>, and falling to his death.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 23-4-2010(2): &quot;Hurry up! I&#039;m already beginning to <strong>MOISTEN</strong>&quot;, she says. &quot;Actually, it feels almost as if drops of <em>WATER</em> are about to start sliding down my thigh any minute now!&quot; This is all in anticipation of &quot;doing it&quot; on the <em>ROOF</em>... Life is good.
