## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 6-10-2007(45): How do you know if a tree is a<strong> maple tree</strong>? Easy: Just stand next to the <em>tree</em> on a <em>wind</em>y day, and if you get covered in maple syrup, it&#039;s a<strong> maple tree</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paasan">paasan</a>] 24-7-2010(7): Hint: Do not confuse between the <em>wind</em> primitive and the <a href="../v4/524.html">wind</a> (#524 風) kanji. The latter I call <em>wind with gnats</em>. (+Katsuo). How do you know if a tree is a<strong> maple tree</strong>? Easy: Just stand next to the <em>tree</em> on a <em>wind</em>y day, and if you get covered in of maple syrup and <em>gnats</em>, it&#039;s a<strong> maple tree</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 30-4-2011(2): 楓 =花楓＊(かえで), <a href="../v4/2471.html">maple tree</a> (#2471 楓) 名 :かえで, ... Parts: 木 , 風 <a href="../v4/524.html">wind</a> (#524 風) ... Story:(Since this is &#039;always&#039; a name kanji) Getting <em>Wood</em> like a <strong>Maple Tree</strong> just from the <em>Wind</em> blowing? Not at at all. <strong>Kaede</strong> is just that sexy. (note the odd reading for the river 楓川 (もみじがわ) for the river in Chuo, tokyo.) .

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 17-1-2009(1): <strong>Maple</strong>Story is a game where you walk around <em><strong>tree</strong></em>s against the <em>wind</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura">taikura</a>] 2-12-2008(1): The<strong> maple tree</strong> has seeds which are shaped like the blades of a helicoptor. The <em>tree</em> releases the seeds and the <em>wind</em> carries them far East (i.e. the wind Kanji is to the right of the tree Kanji in this character).
