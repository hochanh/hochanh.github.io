## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 16-2-2007(29): If you can&#039;t <em>fit</em> through the <em>gates</em> due to your size, try the<strong> side gate</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 28-1-2011(7): 太閤 たいこう　This refers to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, an important Japanese historical figure who ruled Japan for awhile. His secret to surviving in the warring states period was to always have a<strong> side gate</strong> for a quick escape. He built this gate so only he would fit through, and anyone chasing him couldn&#039;t follow.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/EusthEnoptEron">EusthEnoptEron</a>] 20-12-2008(3): Apart from the big <em>gates of hell</em>, there are many<strong> side gate</strong>s leading out of hell. But they&#039;re designed to always be too little for the person trying to escape to <em>fit</em> through. Invented by the devil to drive the humans to despair.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 11-3-2010(1): In fortifications with main gates, there is often a small<strong> side gate</strong> either next door or built into one of the main gates. They only risk opening the main <em>gates</em> if something is too bulky to <em>fit</em> through the<strong> side gate</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 11-8-2009(1): When I want to sneak out of the house, I don&#039;t use the main <em>gates</em>. I squeeze out of the small<strong> side gate</strong>; it&#039;s a tight <em>fit</em>, but it works.
