## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 5-8-2006(50): Can&#039;t work with the Heisig primitive of Dachshund, as the all<strong> encompassing</strong> <em>big eel</em> is obviously the mythical Norse Midgard Snake.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 23-1-2008(48): The DACHSHUND is so long he can stretch himself around the circumference of the earth,<strong> encompassing</strong> the whole globe. (It might help to think of the dachshund as the slinky dog from Toy Story.).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cb4960">cb4960</a>] 15-10-2007(12): The <em>St. Bernard</em> swallowed a live <em>eel</em> in one piece. Now its stomach is <strong>encompassing</strong> the entire <em>eel</em>. Actually, the <em>eel</em> is getting pretty pissed off and is shocking the <em>St. Bernard</em> from the inside. (As a primitive this will be an Asian McDonald&#039;s Big Mac made with eel and dog instead of beef and worm.).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bennyb">bennyb</a>] 25-1-2010(9): According to Jim Breen (and cross-checked in Nelson&#039;s Modern Dict) the most &quot;common&quot; usage of this kanji is <a href="midori://search?text=奄々、エンエン">奄々、エンエン</a> , meaning breathing, covering or obstructing. Or this idiom: &quot; 気息奄奄 【きそくえんえん】 gasping for breath; on the brink of death; more dead than alive.&quot; I&#039;ve chosen to call this &quot;obstructed breath.&quot; (although I like astridtops big eel as a primitive) SO The big eel wrapped my neck and obstructed my breath - like that scene in the Princess Bride =).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 11-10-2008(5): <em>Colossus #7</em> (a <em>large eel</em> from the game Shadow of the Colossus) is<strong> encompassing</strong> the whole screen with its mass.
