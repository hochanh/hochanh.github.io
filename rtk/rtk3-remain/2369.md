## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 27-6-2009(24): I gave the <em>angel</em> a <em>flower</em>. In return she gifted me with a year&#039;s supply of<strong> buckwheat</strong> to feed my family.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 27-5-2007(22): &quot;Buckwheat&#039;s been shot!<strong> Buckwheat</strong>&#039;s been shot!&quot; At his funeral, attended by the rest of Our Gang,<strong> Buckwheat</strong> is placed in his coffin covered by flowers. An angel is also present, and says &quot;Its O-tay<strong> Buckwheat</strong>, you have been invited up to heaven!&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 8-3-2007(14): Grain from the<strong> buckwheat</strong> <em>plant</em> can be used for some <em>angelically</em> tasting cakes.
