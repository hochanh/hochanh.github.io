## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 26-10-2007(38): Souring in the <em>winds</em> there is only <em>one bird</em> left. The<strong> phoenix</strong>. It scorched the other birds, never to return...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 26-1-2010(17): (The extra stroke combines with <em>white</em> in the bird component to make a <em>hundred-year-old bird</em>) The<strong> Phoenix</strong> -- the bird made famous in myth, that after it reaches <em>hundreds</em> of years of age, is reborn and rises again on the <em>wind</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 24-4-2008(15): The famed <strong>Ho-oh</strong> rides the wind above all other birds. 鳳 appears to refer to the male bird, while 凰 refers to the female, presumably one whose beauty is coveted by emperors. (The generic word Ho-oh is the compound 鳳凰 . Note that technically this is not the<strong> Phoenix</strong> but shares some similarities.).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 31-12-2006(6): The<strong> phoenix</strong> is a legendary <em>bird</em>, that when the <em>ceiling</em> of its existence is reached, goes up in the flames of spontaneous combustion. However, when his ashes are thrown into the <em>wind</em>, the<strong> phoenix</strong> will be reborn.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 14-2-2007(4): The<strong> phoenix</strong> is a <em>bird</em> that can reach the <em>ceiling</em> of the <em>wind</em>.
