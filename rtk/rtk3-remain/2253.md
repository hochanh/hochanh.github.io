## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 10-11-2008(29): You reach into a bag of <strong>assorted</strong> lollies with your <em>fingers</em> and pull out <em>two snakes stuck together</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 27-1-2010(20): This is an<strong> assortment</strong> of chocolate <em>fingers</em> all pointing <em>south-east</em> ( 巽 is <a href="../v4/2861.html">southeast</a> (#2861 巽)) i.e. all angled towards the lower-right corner of the box.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 15-5-2007(8): You can always find something from his <strong>assortment</strong> of stolen watches. <em>Fingers</em>, the thief, can pull back his sleeve and allow you to <em>elect</em> (without the road work) any of the watches from his extensive <strong>assortment</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Corodon">Corodon</a>] 17-7-2009(6): At the pet store, they have an <strong>assortment</strong> of snakes. I pointed my <em>finger</em> at the one I wanted, but the owner said I really should buy <em>two snakes</em> <em>together</em>, because otherwise they get lonely. I named my new snakes McCain and Obama, since this kanji looks a lot like <a href="../v4/1804.html">elect</a> (#1804 選).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 13-5-2009(3): Noah is about to <a href="../v4/1804.html">elect</a> (#1804 選) <em>snakes</em> for his <em>arc</em>. It takes a while since there is a huge<strong> assortment</strong>. He <em>points</em> at two snakes. &quot;You and you! The rest can go now, sorry...!
