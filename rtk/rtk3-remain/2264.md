## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 23-1-2009(26): The keyword in the book is &quot;receptacle&quot; (which is an actual word unlike<strong> receptable</strong>). I picture a kidnapping demand where a finger and a lock of hair of the victim is placed into a receptacle and sent to the family.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 16-6-2007(18): Why are you holding that <em>lock of hair</em>, man? Are your <em>fingers</em> even clean? Go put that thing into a trash <strong>receptacle</strong>. No! Not your <em>fingers</em>, the <em>lock</em>. <strong>Receptacle</strong> seems to work...especially since<strong> receptable</strong> isn&#039;t a word.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 26-7-2009(8): <em>Finger</em>prints and <em>locks of hair</em> must be placed and stored in proper <strong>receptacles</strong> in order to be admissible as evidence.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 28-11-2007(7): This is probably supposed to be &quot;receptacle&quot; (e.g. 茶托 = saucer for teacup, which is sort of a &quot;tea receptacle&quot;), though it can also mean &quot;entrust with&quot; and even &quot;hint&quot; and &quot;pretend&quot; according to my dictionary.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/j0k0m0">j0k0m0</a>] 31-1-2011(1): Pinky keeps a lock of hair in a locket. He:s a kind of Oたく。 茶托 tea cup.
