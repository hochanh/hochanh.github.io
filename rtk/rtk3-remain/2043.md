## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 5-8-2006(120): I&#039;m not going to use &#039;this here&#039; as a primitive because it&#039;s too vague. But &#039;stop and sit down&#039;, usually tied to a tour guide explaining scenery works for me.//<em>Stop</em> and <em>sit down</em> to have a look at<strong> this here</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tommy">Tommy</a>] 15-6-2008(33): A wildlife explorer, let&#039;s call him Steve Irwin, the sadly passed away wildlife expert, is tracking down an animal in a forest. He finds a <em>footprint</em>, and gets out a <em>spoon</em> to taste it. He scrapes the spoon over the floor and tries it. &quot;Now,<strong> this here</strong> is a crocodile footprint&quot; he announces.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 21-7-2009(21): I&#039;ll <em>stop</em> and <em>sit down</em> on<strong> this here</strong>, whatever it is.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 16-2-2010(16): Welcome to RtK3. I&#039;ll be your guide for a few stories along the way. astridtops wisely advises you to &#039;stop &amp; sit down&#039; here. The combo occurs only 4 more times, not counting 2 you already know, but still, he&#039;s right: <em>stop</em>, <em>sit down</em>. My best advice going forward is to follow your 雌 <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/563">feminine/female</a> (#563 雌) instincts, but <em>kill the turkey</em>. He&#039;ll require resuscitation 14 times, but invariably will be done in by other primitives anyway, &amp; so <em>stop, sit down</em>, ponder<strong> this here</strong> beginning, <em>kill the turkey</em>, &amp; bon voyage!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KristinHolly">KristinHolly</a>] 9-12-2008(11): Stop and get a spoon because<strong> this here</strong> is the best pudding you&#039;ve ever tasted!
