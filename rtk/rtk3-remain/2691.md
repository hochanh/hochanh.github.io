## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 22-5-2009(26): 螺 (にし) is a fresh water mollusk with a shell like a<strong> screw</strong>. When the mollusk has died the shell is used by <em>insects</em> like a house. Thus, <em>insects accumulate</em> in the<strong> screw</strong> shell.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 16-2-2007(15): <em>Insects accumulate</em> if a<strong> screw</strong> is missing.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 29-6-2007(9): I’ve <em>accumulated</em> so many <em>insects</em> at this point, I could easily<strong> screw</strong> anyone over.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brose">brose</a>] 3-4-2007(7): If too many insects accumulate you&#039;re<strong> screw</strong>ed ラ にし にな a small; edible; helical fresh-water mollusk.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 23-2-2010(3): How many <em>insects</em> does it take to <strong>screw</strong> in a lightbulb? Obviously, at least two, but how did they <em>accumulate</em> inside there in the first place?
