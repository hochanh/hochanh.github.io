## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 15-9-2008(18): A characteristic of an<strong> outpost</strong> is the lack of usual facilities. Here we see a <em>fortune teller</em> with no crystal ball having to make do with a <em>vase</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alucardchuu">alucardchuu</a>] 24-5-2010(13): At a good<strong> outpost</strong>, there are guards standing and a fortune teller that can foresee any threat to stop it on time.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 25-5-2008(11): Stand up, fortune telling: Something scary happened at the Mars<strong> outpost</strong> near the alien ruins. Suddenly, one of the soldiers <em>stood up</em> and started to <em>tell fortunes</em>. (Which weren&#039;t all that positive for mankind). Then he fell down and never spoke again.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 12-7-2007(5): &quot;Sorry sir, its your <em>fortune</em> in life to <em>stand</em> outside your post at the<strong> outpost</strong> and keep watch. Look, I don&#039;t like it one bit either, but your <em>fortune</em> is clear as day, no point in fighting it.&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 19-2-2007(3): There really isn&#039;t much to do in that<strong> outpost</strong>, the only attraction is someone <em>fortunetelling</em> with big <em>vases</em>. You pay, then you draw a lot from one of the <em>vases</em> and it will tell your fortune.
