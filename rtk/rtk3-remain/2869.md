## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 9-2-2007(46): <em>Twenty</em> birds (swallows) are perched at the <em>north exit</em> ( 北口 ) of the station. I light a <em>fire</em> underneath them, and as they wilt and fall in the heat, passing commuters<strong> swallow</strong> them whole. Well, they are<strong> swallow</strong>s.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 31-7-2009(15): <em>Twenty</em><strong> swallow</strong>s are perched atop the station&#039;s 北口 raining <em>droppings</em> all over everyone. Keep your <em>mouth</em> closed so you don&#039;t<strong> swallow</strong> any. (Thanks Katsuo).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 9-3-2010(4): Stroke order: <em>twenty, mouth, north, oven fire</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 2-1-2009(2): Twenty<strong> swallow</strong>s at the north exit of the station. The bottom part is a pictograph of their tail feathers.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Panta">Panta</a>] 22-3-2013(1): Hint: Now is a good chance to learn the verb &quot;to<strong> swallow</strong>&quot; as well, which is simply a mouth to the left of the bird: 嚥.
