## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jamiemw">jamiemw</a>] 10-9-2008(27): <strong>Lye</strong> is white like <em>rocksalt</em> and can be broken up with an <em>ice pick</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 20-7-2007(15): <strong>Lye</strong> is white like <em>rocksalt</em> and sharp like an <em>awl</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 10-3-2011(12): (Agreed with Hissatsu, <strong>Soap</strong> it is!) STORY: This new &quot;natural&quot; hippy soap is ridiculous! It&#039;s hard as a <em>rock</em>, smells like <em>salt</em>, and I have to chips pieces of it off with an <em>awl</em> (or ice pick) just to use it!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hissatsu">hissatsu</a>] 29-11-2010(8): <strong>Soap</strong> is a far better keyword than<strong> lye</strong> ( 鹸 is only used in words referring to soap). &quot;In the final step in making <strong>soap</strong>, I add <em>rocksalt</em> and stir with an <em>awl</em>.&quot; (Sort of true, in some soap production, salt is added to precipitate soap from the solution).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 17-4-2009(5): Licking what he thought was <em>rocksalt</em>, <em>Frankenstein</em> (the <em>fit</em>-together <em>man</em>) suddenly feels his tongue burning. Those kids lied to him...it wasn&#039;t rocksalt, it was<strong> lye</strong>!
