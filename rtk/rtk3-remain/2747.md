## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 29-7-2009(24): When filling a <em>whiskey bottle</em> with a<strong> whey</strong> mixture, you&#039;ve got to get the proportions <em>just so</em> or it will just taste like curdled milk.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 10-3-2009(18): If you hold the <em>whiskey bottle</em> <em>just so</em>, it scoops up the &#039;isk&#039; out of the &#039;whiskey&#039; and you&#039;re left with &#039;whey&#039;. &#039;No way!&#039; &#039;Whey!&#039;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 2-3-2010(4): Little Miss Muffet and Goldilocks both enjoyed eating curds and<strong> whey</strong>, but Goldilocks insisted on putting a little <em>whiskey</em> in her<strong> whey</strong>. Not too much, though; she insisted on measuring it out so the taste was <em>juuust right</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/enryu">enryu</a>] 3-9-2009(4): Mix Whiskey and<strong> Whey</strong> protein and drink.. Mmm just so perfectly tasty. (I just vomited...Anyone weight training knows what im talking about).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki">CasualTatsumaki</a>] 27-7-2010(2): When working out, you want to drink<strong> whey</strong> protein powder for muscle building and a little whiskey - just so, not too much - for a little aggressiveness but not inebriated. 醍醐味 だいごみ the best; the epitome (lit. the flavor of<strong> whey</strong> and boiled butter).
