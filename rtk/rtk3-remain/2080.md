## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 17-12-2006(49): After planting the <em>saplings</em>, the villagers open their <em>mouth</em> and<strong> quaff</strong> large quantities of sake!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 16-10-2008(33): The <em>fairy</em> spreads her legs over my <em>mouth</em> to let me<strong> quaff</strong> her moisture.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 18-3-2010(13): The roots of a <em>sapling</em> are like a <em>mouth</em>,<strong> quaff</strong>ing water and nutrients - so as to grow <em>big</em> and no longer be just a <em>drop</em>. Note that<strong> quaff</strong>ing component 口 is positioned where it should be (in roots below sapling).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 26-4-2007(4): They really <strong>quaff</strong> it down! It&#039;s amazing that young <em>sapling</em>s have large enough <em>mouth</em>s to <strong>quaff</strong> anything down.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 28-4-2008(2): Sapling, mouth: The booze made by cooking these <em>saplings</em> is so amazing that everyone watching the cooking process is already drooling from their <em>mouths</em>, ready to<strong> quaff</strong> the stuff away when it&#039;s ready.
