## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-10-2008(40): This<strong> overhang</strong> has so much shade it&#039;s <em>comparable</em> to being in a <em>cave</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 21-4-2007(25): This<strong> overhang</strong> is really good against the warmth. <em>Compared</em> with other<strong> overhang</strong>s, this one makes you feel as cool as if you are in a <em>cave</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 1-8-2008(10): You go with a friend into a deep, dark cave for a really dangerous (and stupid) contest - the<strong> overhang</strong> contest. There is a dark, cramped tunnel that you crawl through, which leads to a (as far as you know) bottomless pit. You and your friends take turns <strong>overhang</strong>ing off the<strong> overhang</strong> - and whoever can stand to<strong> overhang</strong> into the pitch dark the longest (did I mention that there are strange animal-like noises coming from the bottom?), wins - and you <em>compare</em> times on a score sheet.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/melchan">melchan</a>] 30-1-2011(3): The <em>cave</em><strong> overhang</strong> is composed of two giant <em>spoons</em> at the entrance.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 29-5-2009(3): A couple <em>SPOONING</em> in a <em>CAVE</em>. They are not alone so they use an<strong> overhang</strong> to hide under it.
