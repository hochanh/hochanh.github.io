1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 24-6-2007(53): How to obtain<strong> quill</strong>s for free: Wait for a misty day, then under cover of the <em>mist</em> creep up on an unsuspecting bird and quickly cover it with your <em>umbrella</em>. The bird will flap around wildly trying to escape and while doing so will shed a number of <em>feathers</em>. You can use these as<strong> quill</strong>s.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 29-7-2009(3): The latest<strong> quill</strong>s are <em>feathers</em> with an <em>umbrella</em>-like point that sprays <em>mist</em> you can write with.
