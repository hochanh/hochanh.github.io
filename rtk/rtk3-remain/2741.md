## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 16-7-2007(42): After He lost a leg in combat, our <em>sovereign king</em> got a <em>wooden leg</em> as a replacement. Since He thought it was a little boring, he added a<strong> hoof</strong> for kicks. (Wow, that was totally unintentional, I like).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 5-11-2007(6): Our <em>sovereign</em> is horse-crazy and even had her own <em>wooden leg</em> fitted with a<strong> hoof</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 29-7-2009(3): The <em>sovereign</em> customized his <em>peg leg</em> with a<strong> hoof</strong> because it seemed to have more horsepower.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kumakuma">kumakuma</a>] 2-12-2008(2): After he added<strong> hoof</strong>s to his FEET, the SOVEREIGN thought that he wouldnt need any horse anymore. I am doing fine without one! he says.
