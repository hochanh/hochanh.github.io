## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 17-7-2007(22): Each<strong> livraison</strong> (installment) of the <em>scrapbook</em> is delivered by post, and sits resting on your <em>doorstep</em> for when you get home. Of course, it might blow away so the postman has put heavy <em>bamboo blocks</em> on top of it.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 2-6-2008(14): Bamboo, konbini hentai: The special issue of the popular <em>konbini hentai</em> is divided into different <strong>livraisons</strong> (installment). Each comes with a small piece of <em>bamboo</em>, which are - after obtaining all <strong>livraisons</strong>- combined in a <em>bamboo</em> nude statue the female main character!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 26-11-2008(9): A limited<strong> livraison</strong> (edition) of <em>manga</em> made of <em>bamboo</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 27-3-2010(1): The<strong> LIVRAISON</strong> depicted here is the original <em>folio</em> of an ancient text, written on thin <em>BAMBOO</em> strips. They had curled up with age, and so that be carefully <em>FLATTEN</em>ed. (NB: <em>FLATTEN</em> is my keyword for the non-RTK character 扁, as in 扁平 【へんぺい】=flat.).
