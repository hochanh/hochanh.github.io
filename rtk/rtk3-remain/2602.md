## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 24-1-2007(25): Ancient Japanese officials collected their<strong> salarium</strong> in the shrines. A priest would collect their <em>rice grains</em> with a <em>broom</em>, and sweep it unto the <em>altar</em>, where the officials could collect their rice.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 20-2-2008(11): Rather than cold hard cash, the <em>rice</em> that the <em>altar</em> boys could <em>sweep</em> up became their<strong> salarium</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 21-2-2010(5): Since rice was a form of currency back then, <em>altar</em> boys in the Catholic Church used to <em>sweep up</em> and collect the <em>rice grains</em> after a wedding, and considered it their<strong> salarium</strong> in exchange for their underage sex services.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 22-5-2009(4): The<strong> salarium</strong> for the Japanes army is not money. They are paid with <em>videotapes</em> (录, see record <a href="../v4/1144.html">record</a> (#1144 録). The higher the rank, the longer and dirtier the film :-).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shonb6570">Shonb6570</a>] 12-5-2011(2): This word is obsolete - It comes from the Roman era when soldiers were paid with salt, or rather, &quot;salarium argentum&quot;, which means something like &quot;salt money&quot;. Incoincidentally, it is where the term, &quot;Worth your salt&quot; comes from. Heisig&#039;s word choice for some of these is asinine. The Kanji means &quot;salary&quot; or &quot;stipend&quot;.
