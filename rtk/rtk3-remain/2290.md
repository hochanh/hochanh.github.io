## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 28-7-2008(33): You have got a really, really plugged up bathtub - so plugged up, as a matter of fact, that when you get out of the bath, it takes an entire <em>decameron</em> for the gently<strong> swirling waters</strong> to go all the way down. You are really annoyed at this (it&#039;s gross, besides), so you get a tiny little <em>sun</em> and <em>bound it up</em> with twine, and lower it into the drain. It clears the clog right up, and the <em>swirling waters</em> zip right on down!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 7-1-2007(23): For <em>ten days</em>, we watched the<strong> swirling waters</strong>, but it didn&#039;t seem like the <em>water</em> would rise in another tsunami.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 1-7-2010(6): Without the<strong> swirling waters</strong> of a toilet, you may have to hold your <em>water</em> for a <em>decameron</em>. How&#039;s that for bladder training?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/At0m5k">At0m5k</a>] 9-8-2009(5): Swirling <em>waters</em> are <strong>truly</strong> a wonderful thing to behold. I could watch them for a whole <em>decameron</em> and never get bored. (I haven&#039;t been able to find any other reference stating that this kanji means<strong> swirling waters</strong>, so I&#039;m going with <strong>truly</strong> as the main meaning).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 12-8-2011(3): 洵 , 洵美 , <a href="../v4/2290.html">swirling waters</a> (#2290 洵)ジュン( 旬 ), まこと ... Parts:氵, 旬 <a href="../v4/67.html">decameron</a> (#67 旬) (cf: 殉 <a href="../v4/809.html">martyrdom</a> (#809 殉), 詢 <a href="../v4/2705.html">counsel</a> (#2705 詢), 恂<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/24642">Unicode-0x6042</a> (#24642 恂) ... Note: Keyword just a mnemonic, 洵 , 詢 , 恂, are all male names read まこと or ジュン. Many other kanji share the readings. ... Story: You note the <strong>Swirling <em>Waters</em></strong> after you take a bath for the first time in <em>Ten Days</em> in <em>June</em>(reading).
