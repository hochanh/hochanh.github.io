## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 6-10-2007(42): A<strong> lotus</strong> can either be a <em>flower</em>, or else something that <em>take</em>s you <em>along</em> (the car make).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 4-1-2009(18): <strong>Lotus</strong> can be either a flower or a car on the road.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 29-7-2008(5): Way too easy!<strong> Lotus</strong>, as in the really expensive, fast car. Whenever I want to take someone somewhere ( 連れる ）, I make sure to rent a<strong> Lotus</strong> so that I can arrive to pick them up in style. I&#039;m a great customer of the local car rental shop, so they always make sure to give me a <em>flower</em> when I pick up my<strong> Lotus</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 13-4-2010(1): [This is a bit of a follow up to my <a href="../v4/1013.html">baggage</a> (#1013 荷) story.] There&#039;s a superstition that the<strong> LOTUS</strong> brings good luck during trips. Specifically, one must <em>TAKE ALONG</em> as many of these <em>FLOWER</em>s as possible. Thus the<strong> LOTUS</strong> is nicknamed the <em>&quot;TAKE-ALONG FLOWER&quot;</em>. (They sure can make your <a href="../v4/1013.html">baggage</a> (#1013 荷) unwieldy and conspicuous, but that&#039;s actually a good omen.).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 6-1-2007(1): Some people like to <em>carry along</em><strong> lotus</strong> <em>flowers</em> for good luck.
