## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 5-6-2008(32): Fish, autumn: Old man to his son: &quot;You are <strong>bullheaded</strong> if you think you can catch a<strong> bullhead</strong> <em>fish</em> in the middle of <em>autumn</em>. It&#039;s out of season!&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 20-3-2010(7): Perhaps a bit of a misnomer.<strong> Bullhead</strong> is a river fish (カジカ). This kanji is most likely to refer to young Japanese yellowtail or <strong>amberjack</strong>. It is a fish of many names depending on age: fry (もじゃこ), young ( <a href="midori://search?text=鰍・いなだ">鰍・いなだ</a> or 魬・はまち), mature (鰤・ぶり). I suppose these kanji might crop up on a fish menu. STORY: Young <strong>Amberjack</strong> is not at its best in summer. Eat from <strong>autumn</strong> onwards (when it becomes more fatty). Also its tail is amber - the colour of <em>autumn</em> leaves.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 30-7-2009(1): A<strong> bullhead</strong> is a <em>fish</em> that thrives in waters as warm as <em>autumn</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 18-7-2007(1): The real reason beaches are so empty during <em>autumn</em>: that&#039;s the only season the<strong> bullhead</strong> <em>fish</em> bring up their heads.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 12-2-2011(): Both my dictionaries agree with Heisig and call this<strong> bullhead</strong>, not amberjack. From Abaddon: Fish, autumn: Old man to his son: &quot;You are<strong> bullhead</strong>ed if you think you can catch a<strong> bullhead</strong> fish in the middle of autumn. It&#039;s out of season!&quot;.
