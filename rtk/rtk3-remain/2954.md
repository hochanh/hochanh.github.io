## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 15-8-2008(20): This is a<strong> Brahman</strong>, a fully enlightened one. He&#039;s sitting in front of a <em>grove</em> of <em>trees</em>, legs open (looks like <em>wind</em>), just meditating. You run up to him asking him all sorts of crazy questions, and he looks at you and smiles. &quot;<strong>Brah, man, just chill, man. </strong>Braaaaah#.&quot; Apparently he&#039;s a surfer<strong> brahman</strong>. You ask him the meaning of life, and he smiles, and waits...waits...waits...until a bit of wind blows by. He lets out a small <em>fart</em> in the <em>wind</em>, and nods knowingly at you.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cb4960">cb4960</a>] 16-2-2009(13): <strong>Brahman</strong> who are <em>mediocre</em> don&#039;t get the sweet meditation spots on the beach. Instead, they have to settle for a <em>grove</em> of trees.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 7-9-2009(4): I abandon my <em>mediocre</em> language in the <em>woods</em> in order to learn <strong>Sanskrit</strong>, what a beautiful language... <a href="http://jp.youtube.com/watch?v=HP1FoZpdNtM">http://jp.youtube.com/watch?v=HP1FoZpdNtM</a> (Sa Ding Ding - Alive).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/HolyKotor">HolyKotor</a>] 28-12-2011(2): <strong>Sanskrit</strong> is the liturgical language of Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. Most people who speak <strong>Sanskrit</strong> willingly live <em>mediocre</em> lives in <em>groves</em> of <em>trees</em> to seek enlightenment from <strong>Brahman</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 30-10-2009(2): Like many<strong> brahman</strong>s, this one owns a <em>grove</em>, but he is not as rich as his<strong> brahman</strong> brethren and so his grove is <em>mediocre</em>.
