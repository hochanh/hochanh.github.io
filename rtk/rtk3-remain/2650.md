## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 16-2-2007(42): The <em>uncivilized</em> used <em>rice</em> as<strong> paste</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 29-6-2007(19): Let the <em>rice age</em> for one <em>month</em> and it becomes an absolutely wonderful<strong> paste</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Sam79">Sam79</a>] 15-7-2011(9): The meaning is starch used as glue to<strong> paste</strong> things. While in Japan they used to extract that<strong> paste</strong> from <a href="../v4/919.html">rice</a> (#919 米), in the West <em>old flesh</em> served that purpose. The old flesh of horses and other waste from the slaughterhouse that was boiled to extract gelatin. Seems rather <a href="../v4/2470.html">uncivilized</a> (#2470 胡) to me, I like the rice-approach better...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/peacemik">peacemik</a>] 24-8-2011(3): While they were still <em>uncivilized</em>, they used <em>months-old rice</em> to make glue<strong> paste</strong>. 糊 [のり]:<strong> paste</strong>; glue; starch 糊口 [ここう]: bare livelihood; subsistence 糊口 [ここう] を 凌 [しの]ぐ: eke out a living.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 17-1-2009(2): My <em>american</em> friend is so <em>uncivilised</em> his staple diet consists of tooth<strong>paste</strong> rather than <em>rice</em>.
