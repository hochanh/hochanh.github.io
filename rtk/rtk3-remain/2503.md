1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 22-5-2008(31): Tree, horse: At cooking school, I learned that there&#039;s always a relation between the item you will pestle and the size of the pestle itself. When I read in a cooking book that I had to mash up a <em>horse</em> with a<strong> wooden pestle</strong>, naturally a tried to obtain a <em>tree</em> to do the job.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 20-6-2007(11): Ah, nothing like using a<strong> wooden pestle</strong> to mash up some <em>horse</em> meat on a Sunday <em>afternoon</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 5-10-2006(5): At <em>noon</em> she used a<strong> wooden pestle</strong> (made out of a <em>tree</em>) to prepare her lunch.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Miyumera">Miyumera</a>] 4-1-2013(2): This<strong> WOODEN pestle</strong> used to make food at NOON. Think of a clock striking 12 noon and chiming.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 5-12-2009(1): That <em>horse</em> was being a pest &amp; so I whacked him with a<strong> wooden pestle</strong> &amp; knocked off his tail feathers.
