## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 9-11-2007(47): (Note: <em>ear</em> + <em>city walls</em> = <a href="../v4/2680.html">exclamation</a> (#2680 耶)). I see a <em>tree</em> with an <em>exclamation</em> mark painted on it. &quot;Why is that?&quot; I think, &quot;An <em>exclamation</em> mark indicates danger, but it&#039;s only a <em>tree</em>&quot;. Then a coconut drops on my head. Ah, it&#039;s a<strong> coconut tree</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-7-2009(11): A<strong> coconut tree</strong> drops a coconut on your head, causing you to make an obscene <a href="../v4/2680.html">exclamation</a> (#2680 耶).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 21-12-2007(2): A bare<strong> coconut tree</strong> is like an <em>exclamation</em> point. A leaf-less stick of a <em>tree</em> with a fallen coconut at the bottom.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/didz13">didz13</a>] 19-6-2011(1): I imagine a Super Mario-like side-scroller in which there is a bonus stage where a big <em>tree</em> throws coconuts with <em>question marks</em> on them. Hit them to get coins and goodies!().

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869">perrin4869</a>] 10-1-2012(): People sneaking into the city by silently jumping from a <strong>coconut tree</strong> over the <em>wall with ears</em> (frame <a href="../v4/2680.html">exclamation</a> (#2680 耶)).
