## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 28-5-2007(41): First the <em>flowers</em> grow up, but if you aren&#039;t attentive, they have a tendency to<strong> grow wild</strong>, playing <em>dice</em> out in the garden to kill time. A bad seed, indeed. Flowers grown wild!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/haabaato">haabaato</a>] 11-3-2008(25): Some kids playing the board game Jumanji throw the <em>dice</em>, and as a result, <em>flowers</em> suddenly begin to<strong> grow wild</strong> all around them.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 17-7-2009(4): It was my <em>turn</em> last week to weed the <em>flower</em> garden, so that&#039;s why it&#039;s starting to<strong> grow wild</strong> now. Lesson learned from this: don&#039;t ask me to weed the flowers.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-7-2009(2): The ladies<strong> grow wild</strong> when I give them <em>flowers</em> when it&#039;s their <em>turn</em> with me.
