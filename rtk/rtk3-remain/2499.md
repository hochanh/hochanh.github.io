## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Crowfoot">Crowfoot</a>] 15-4-2008(46): When you see<strong> bellflower</strong>s next to a <em>tree</em>, ring them for <em>good luck</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 16-10-2006(9): When you see<strong> bellflower</strong>s growing under a <em>tree</em>, it means <em>good luck</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 13-7-2010(6): If you&#039;re climbing a <em>tree</em>, it&#039;s <em>good luck</em> to bring a<strong> bellflower</strong> with you, because then if you get stuck you can ring it to call for help.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Gwindarr">Gwindarr</a>] 13-6-2008(1): Alright, the<strong> bellflower</strong> tree has no flowers and no bells. In place of these are aerosol cans which bloom out of the tree and occasionally clink together which must be how the tree got its name.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 9-2-2011(): We used to have lots of <em>trees</em> and<strong> bellflower</strong>s in our home in Sydney. It was great until someone came with an aerosol can and destroyed everything.
