Imagine seeing footage of a place where those<em> sickness-missiles</em> are built : rows after rows of <em>missiles</em>, and if you look closely on each is inscribed in tiny letters the name of different <em>sickness</em> such as &quot;flu&quot;, &quot;plague&quot;, etc.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 21-5-2009(12): When a <em>sick caveman</em> sneezes, the germs shoot out of his mouth like a <em>missile</em>. Ironically, this biological <em>missile</em> is much more deadly than any spear the <em>caveman</em> could throw, especially if it results in an <strong>epidemic</strong>.
