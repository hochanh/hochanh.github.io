1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 24-12-2007(239): <em>Caveman</em> got <strong>ill</strong> after flying <em>third class</em>. The cabin air and food got to him. (Primitive: these all got MUCH easier when using <em>CAVEMAN</em> instead. ).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 5-2-2007(59): If you hang around a <em>third class</em> hospital, you&#039;ll get<strong> ill</strong> with the <em>sickness</em> everyone else has.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yorkii">yorkii</a>] 2-7-2006(27): Note: according to this <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/">http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/</a>~jwb/cgi-bin/wwwhalsod.cgi?3277_%C9%C2 the stroke order is different to that presented in the Heisig book. 4th and 5th strokes are reversed.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 12-7-2009(25): I have this female friend who complains about <em>third class</em> type stuff a lot. She&#039;ll say stuff like &#039;&#039;That train ride made me<strong> ill</strong>. Seriously,&#039;&#039; and &#039;&#039;Oh my god, sitting next that dirty guy made me<strong> ill</strong>. Seriously.&#039;&#039; Sometimes I just want to kick her in the cunt.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 28-2-2007(22): Hint: The<strong> ill</strong> in<strong> ill</strong> almost looks like the roman numeral <strong>III</strong>. Use as a hint to 3rd class. The<strong> ill</strong> are more abundant in <em>third class</em> countries (<em>third world</em>).
