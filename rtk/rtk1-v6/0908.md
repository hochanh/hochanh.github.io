1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rich_f">rich_f</a>] 19-7-2007(222): The <em>drop</em> falling here is the <em>husband&#039;s</em> toupee... he&#039;s already <strong>lost</strong> his hair once, now he&#039;s <strong>losing</strong> it again. Such is life, I suppose.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 10-8-2007(64): Note: Heisig&#039;s stroke order is wrong. It&#039;s the same as vermilion, drop first. <em>Homer</em> <strong>loses/drops</strong> his wedding ring.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/marydj">marydj</a>] 21-10-2007(43): My husband is going to<strong> lose</strong> his hair, one drop at a time.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 14-2-2008(22): Homer&#039;s head drops in disappointment when he realizes he lost one of his 2 remaining hairs on his head.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 22-6-2008(11): The <em>husband</em> has <strong>lost</strong> his job ( 失業する ), yet on his way out of the office he bows respectfully one last time (the drop signifying his deep bow), saying &quot;shitsurei shimasu&quot; ( 失礼しあす ).
