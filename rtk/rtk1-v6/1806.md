1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Copycatken">Copycatken</a>] 4-7-2006(132): Even though the furniture is <em>heavy</em>, it&#039;ll be easy to<strong> move</strong> with all the <em>muscles</em> that he has.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kumakuma">kumakuma</a>] 6-7-2008(91): His MUSCLES are so HEAVY, he barely can<strong> move</strong>...thats ironic.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CaLeDee">CaLeDee</a>] 20-9-2008(50): Heavy things can be<strong> move</strong>d with a bit of muscle.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/francajun">francajun</a>] 30-3-2012(16): To<strong> move</strong> something heavy, you need muscles.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sskaggs">sskaggs</a>] 15-11-2012(12): Everyone knows that (Force x Mass= acceleration), and as is typical when converting western expressions to eastern expressions this kanji gives us the same equation in reverse order and pictorialized: (Heavy x Muscle =<strong> Move</strong>). ;-p easy peasy.
