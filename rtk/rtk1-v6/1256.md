1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 28-10-2005(250): It looks like the mouth of <em>Bender the robot</em>, from Matt Groening&#039;s animated series &quot;Futurama&quot;. Thus, I use the character <em>Bender the robot</em> as a primitive.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 5-9-2006(120): Also means &quot;melody&quot;. Think of it as a pictogram of a guitar where you have to <strong>bend</strong> the strings to make a <strong>melody</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 24-4-2009(87): When <em>two sprouts sprout</em> at the same place they don&#039;t have enough space and have to<strong> bend</strong> in different directions to grow...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 27-2-2007(15): Hannibal Lecter exposes his victim&#039;s <em>brains</em> and inserts two <em>walking sticks</em>, using them to<strong> bend</strong> the victim to his will. Note: Heisig implies this, but doesn&#039;t show the actual stroke order. Write this in the same order as <a href="../v4/14.html">rice field</a> (#14 田) but with two extended vertical strokes in the center instead of one short stroke.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura">taikura</a>] 24-12-2008(13): This is a guitar fretboard. You have to<strong> bend</strong> the strings to produce a <em>melody</em>.
