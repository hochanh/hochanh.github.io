In order to play up his feelings he bares his <em>head</em> and holds his <em>crown</em> over his <em>heart</em> then walks (on <em>walking legs</em>) around the palace making everyone see how<strong> melancholy</strong> he is. What a wuss.

His <em>crown</em> of thorns has slipped down and is around his neck, right between his <em>head</em> and his <em>heart</em>. His <em>walking legs</em> can be seen dangling from the cross as well. How<strong> MELANCHOLY</strong>!
