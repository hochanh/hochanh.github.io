1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 20-10-2006(256): <strong>Pining</strong>, yearn for... etc. Presumably for lost love. An easy one here, someone standing in the <em>graveyard</em>, placing an old <em>valentine</em> card amonst all the existing tributes.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 21-10-2005(54): Morticia and Gomez (of the “Addams Family”) are spending their <em>Valentine&#039;s</em> Day at the <em>graveyard</em>,<strong> pining</strong> for each other&#039;s affection.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 11-6-2006(25): Remember the dead parrot from Monty Python&#039;s parrot&#039;s sketch? The shop owner said that the Norwegian Blue was<strong> pining</strong> for the fjords! But of course it should have been put in the <em>graveyard</em> already. Poor buyer, he meant to give the bird away as a <em>valentine</em> present...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/szreter">szreter</a>] 15-2-2008(22): I am in the <em>graveyard</em> <strong>pining</strong> for my lost <em>valentine</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 17-6-2008(15): Imagine an &#039;emo&#039; kid<strong> pining</strong> away in a <em>graveyard</em> because his <em>valentine</em> didn&#039;t turn up... His emo make-up is running because he&#039;s crying now. (Emo kids like to hang out in graveyards &#039;because it&#039;s cool&#039; or something and they were going to have a date there).
