1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 4-6-2008(224): <em>Spidey&#039;</em>s<strong> exploits</strong> are world famous but still The Daily Bugle&#039;s pages <em>blame</em> him for every problem out there.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rptb1">rptb1</a>] 12-11-2005(99): [Geek alert] A lot of modern software is full of<strong> exploits</strong> which can be abused by hackers. I blame multi-threading.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 17-5-2007(30): Thorough psychological analysis reveals that all of Spiderman&#039;s villains are actually obsessed with him and long to be &quot;dominated&quot; by him. Therefore, the citizens of New York have no-one to <em>blame</em> but <em>Spiderman</em> for these villains&#039; reckless<strong> exploits</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 30-6-2009(29): <em>Spiderman&#039;s</em><strong> exploits</strong> have earned him fame and <em>blame</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jajaaan">jajaaan</a>] 12-12-2009(24): The<strong> exploits</strong> of the RTK online community are such that every single poster has personified the thread radical into Spiderman. I blame it on the video games and TV that the kids are watching now-a-days.
