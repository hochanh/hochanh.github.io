1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 14-8-2006(224): Think of the early Christian martyrs who suffered<strong> martyrdom</strong> because of their faith. See them held in cells for 10 days (a decameron) before being fed to the lions. They appear before the chanting Roman crowds as <em>bones</em> to be devoured. Think of what was leftover after the lions finished them off....nothing, not even a pile of <em>bones</em> to bury.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu">ruisu</a>] 14-11-2007(86): The <em>boney</em> man martyred himself during his 10 day hunger-strike.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/imojyochu">imojyochu</a>] 23-8-2008(72): To commerate the saint&#039;s <strong>martyrdom</strong> his BONES will be displayed for a 10-DAY-PERIOD (decameron).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yukkuri_kame">yukkuri_kame</a>] 21-6-2009(46): After being bound up for a day (see <a href="../v4/67.html">decameron</a> (#67 旬)) there was nothing left of Heisig but BONES. He had attained<strong> MARTYRDOM</strong> for the sake of an obscure keyword...

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 19-2-2007(19): Nice. If you know about the Canterbury Tales, you know they were pilgrims going to see a martyrs tomb. Just imagine that they&#039;re going to see the <em>relics(bones)</em> of that <strong>martyr</strong> on their <em>decameron</em>!
