1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stefanot">stefanot</a>] 29-4-2007(284): When<strong> yield</strong>ing, soldiers raise the white <em>flag</em> before <em>exiting</em> from the trenches.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/broderickjeff">broderickjeff</a>] 5-1-2007(71): If you live in Japan, you are only too familiar with the helpful little man who assists you in getting out of every parking lot or parking garage, standing at the exit, waving his flag to make traffic<strong> yield</strong> to you.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb">jameserb</a>] 4-4-2008(26): The yellow flag at the exit indicates one should<strong> yield</strong> to oncoming traffic and pedestrians.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/plumage">plumage</a>] 30-12-2008(17): When you<strong> YIELD</strong> in a battle, you raise the FLAG of surrender then EXIT the battlefield.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 13-5-2008(10): Nobody ever<strong> yield</strong>s to oncoming traffic like they&#039;re supposed to, so they&#039;re trying to make a new law. If you don&#039;t<strong> yield</strong>, a cop will pull you over, make you <em>exit</em> your car, and <em>pee</em> all over you. (Note: I use &quot;pee&quot; for the &quot;flag&quot; primitive).
