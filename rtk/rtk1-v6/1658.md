2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dilandau23">dilandau23</a>] 1-4-2007(25): When we speak of <strong>clearing up</strong> we easily think of both the <em>sun</em> and <em>blue</em> skies. But in another since to<strong> clear up</strong> is the absence of weather. And therefor the reason weather has no place in its writing.
