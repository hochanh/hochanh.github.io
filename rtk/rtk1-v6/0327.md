1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977">mameha1977</a>] 13-11-2007(164): Last night&#039;s date with Miss Sweden was like a<strong> dream</strong>. She even laid <em>flowers</em> over my <em>eyes</em> to <em>crown</em> the perfect <em>evening</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/notgoing2argue">notgoing2argue</a>] 27-3-2007(59): In the movie American Beauty, Kevin Spacey liked to<strong> DREAM</strong> about his daughter&#039;s friend and have a <em>rose petal</em> fall onto his <em>eye</em> from the <em>ceiling</em>. He did this lying in his bed each <em>evening</em>. You can almost see him lying in his bed in this kanji.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 7-10-2007(58): Sweet<strong> dream</strong>s like flowers for the eye are the crown of a perfect evening.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dbooster">dbooster</a>] 16-12-2009(39): In Japan, &quot;flowers over your eyes&quot; is a metaphor for falling asleep and<strong> dream</strong>ing (just as the sandman is in the West). So we can make a little poem: <em>Flowers</em> over your <em>eyes</em>, The <em>crown</em> of a perfect <em>evening</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 18-10-2006(30): I like to think of the sideways eye as a <em>cyclops</em>, either the monster of Greek mythology or the X-Men character. The primitive reappears in <a href="../v4/400.html">demolition</a> (#400 壊) and others. So: Odysseus and his mates carefully hang magical <em>flowers</em> above the evil <em>cyclops</em>. These allow them to take the monster&#039;s <em>crown</em> and escape in the <em>evening</em>, while the monster is peacefully <strong>dreaming</strong>.
