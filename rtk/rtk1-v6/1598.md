1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taijuando">taijuando</a>] 28-6-2006(205): A<strong> two-mat area</strong> is just about as much <em>ground</em> as you will need for a <em>lily</em> pond.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall">pmbeddall</a>] 21-1-2008(114): A<strong> two-mat area</strong> is plenty of space for sleeping in a tent but you won&#039;t be comfortable unless the <em>ground</em> is <em>even</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 5-3-2006(30): A<strong> two-mat area</strong> is exactly how much ground a giant lilypad will cover.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 27-2-2008(21): Place the two mats on the <em>ground</em> <em>even</em>ly to get a<strong> two-mat area</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Weber">Weber</a>] 21-2-2007(15): Since one full tatami mat&#039;s length is twice as long as its width, a two mat area would create an even, square floorspace: a somewhat more convenient unit of measuring the ground.
