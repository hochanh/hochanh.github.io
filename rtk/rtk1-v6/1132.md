1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 5-1-2008(237): Animals use their<strong> urine</strong> to mark their territory. So for them, their body <em>water</em> works as a <em>flag</em> denoting their &quot;country&quot; (<em>why bother? we all know which story you are going to pick</em>).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 15-9-2006(128): Someone is pissing on the American flag, but since the<strong> urine</strong> is clear it looks like water.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 23-5-2008(80): The flag primitive looks like a big &quot;P&quot;. And, let&#039;s face it,<strong> urine</strong> is just pee water. So, &quot;Urine = <em>P Water</em>&quot;. Yes, it&#039;s stupid, but I don&#039;t think I&#039;m gonna forget it now, haha. (I renamed the flag primitive &quot;pee&quot;, it makes for unforgettable stories).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 27-7-2007(30): Animals use<strong> urine</strong> as a &quot;watery flag&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dshill99">dshill99</a>] 20-8-2008(22): <strong>Urine</strong> is <em>water</em> that <em>flags</em> your territory.
