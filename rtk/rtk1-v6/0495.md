1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu">nolusu</a>] 20-6-2009(66): You<strong> visit a shrine</strong> to <em>say</em> your wishes and offer <em>delicious</em> offering to the gods.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 24-7-2007(29): To fat, effete Japanophiles (cheerily munching on 肉まん in the back of the tour bus) hearing the <em>words</em> of the tour guide &quot;Now we will<strong> visit a shrine</strong>&quot; elicits squeals of joy. &quot;Oooooh, how absolutely <em>delicious</em>!&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kioku3">kioku3</a>] 25-8-2009(11): On New Year&#039;s Day, Japanese people usually read the <em>words</em> written on their New Year&#039;s cards (nengajou - 年賀状 ), eat <em>delicious</em> special New Year&#039;s foods and<strong> visit a shrine</strong> to pray for good luck in the coming year (thx mantixen).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Crowfoot">Crowfoot</a>] 27-7-2008(5): As a man of reason, <em>Socrates</em> knows the only reason to<strong> visit a shrine</strong> is for the <em>delicious</em> food.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paasan">paasan</a>] 26-7-2010(4): The only reason for me to <strong>visit a shrine</strong> is to see those <em>deliciously</em> young shrine maidens. Oh, did I <em>say</em> that out loud?
