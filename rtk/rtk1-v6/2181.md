1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 14-1-2006(250): The top 16 strokes are the chinese radical for &quot;dragon&quot;. Joining up both meanings of the radical we can name the top part of this kanji &quot;imperial dragon&quot;. Two-headed snakes do exist as biological curiosities, and they look a bit like a <em>slingshot</em> (with the heads splitting at a junction). Our <em>imperial dragon</em> here, the pet of a Chinese emperor, is a rare &quot;three-headed slingshot-snake&quot; kept in a <em>vase</em> and fed with <em>meat</em>. When the emperor<strong> attack</strong>ed neighbours, his army wore the <em>imperial dragon garment</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jackswitch">jackswitch</a>] 31-3-2009(99): Fuaburisu&#039;s story is incredibly good, but I made it a bit simpler: The <em>imperial dragon</em> is a rare &quot;<em>three-headed slingshot-snake</em>&quot;, kept in a <em>vase</em> and fed with <em>meat</em>. It&#039;s very aggressive, so at feeding time you need to wear the special <em>garment</em> or it will<strong> attack</strong> you.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattimus">mattimus</a>] 27-11-2009(21): You<strong> attack</strong> the <em>Ancient Chinese dragon</em> 龍 with the help of your fire-proof <em>garment</em>. Ref: <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/2981">dragon [old]</a> (#2981 龍).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/plumage">plumage</a>] 23-5-2009(15): Legend of Zelda: Link<strong> ATTACK</strong>S by throwing a VASE at the FLESH of the boss, fires his SLINGSHOT, uses his HOOKshot 3 TIMES, and wears a magic GARMENT, all to try to find its weakness.
