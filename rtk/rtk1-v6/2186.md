1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 15-4-2007(175): <strong>Tempering</strong> should be done with the <em>metal</em> facing <em>east</em>. (If not, the metal may pick up the earth&#039;s magnetic field).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taijuando">taijuando</a>] 16-12-2006(97): In the East, especially Japan ...there are masters of<strong> tempering</strong> <em>metal</em> to great strength....on the Spring of Trivia show in Japan I saw how a Japanese sword ...actually split flying bullets...all because of special Eastern<strong> tempering</strong> techniques.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joesan">joesan</a>] 2-1-2008(36): The old sword smiths of the <em>East</em> were rightly famous. The secret of course was in how they <strong>tempered</strong> the <em>metal</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 9-11-2005(10): <strong>Tempering</strong> metal in the East... sounds like Pittsburgh to me! After all, Pittsburgh is a city in the eastern region of the US and is famous for steel working, or<strong> tempering</strong> of metal.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 6-10-2008(9): The<strong> tempering</strong> of <em>metal</em> was mastered in the <em>East</em> for the making of swords.
