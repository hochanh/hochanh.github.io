1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perfecturbo">perfecturbo</a>] 28-6-2006(398): Wrap your FINGERS around someone&#039;s MOUTH to keep them quiet, then put the KNIFE to their throat to ensure their cooperation. This is the best way to<strong> KIDNAP</strong> someone.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chrislewisca">chrislewisca</a>] 21-3-2007(61): After you <a href="../v4/650.html">beckon</a> (#650 招) someone by seducing them, you<strong> kidnap</strong> them and hang them upside down (the reversed positions of <em>seduce</em>).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zwarte_kat">zwarte_kat</a>] 16-4-2007(33): <strong>Kidnap</strong>ping goes like this, after you<strong> kidnap</strong> somebody, you send one of their fingers. Then you hold a dagger before the mouth of the victim and have him talk so that people know he&#039;s still alive. This balance between cutting of fingers of the victim and having him say he&#039;s all right will make a successful<strong> kidnap</strong>ping. Join us next week on how to perform a good back-alley murder.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 29-4-2006(29): You<strong> kidnap</strong> someone by putting a finger on your mouth (&quot;ssh!&quot;) and a dagger under his.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonnay">jonnay</a>] 21-2-2008(13): <strong>Kidnap</strong>ping is related to, but opposite to <a href="../v4/650.html">beckon</a> (#650 招). If you beckon someone, you ask them to come to you, rather then going to them (to steal them). The kanji is an illustration of that fact, because the <a href="../v4/11.html">mouth</a> (#11 口) is above the <a href="../v4/83.html">sword</a> (#83 刀).
