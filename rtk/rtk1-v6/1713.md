1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FooSoft">FooSoft</a>] 1-1-2010(46): &quot;Gimme all your <em>money</em> <em>now</em>!&quot; said the <strong>covet</strong>ous criminal.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Gaignun">Gaignun</a>] 24-4-2011(32): One begins one&#039;s life <strong>coveting</strong> <em>money</em>. One ends one&#039;s life <strong>coveting</strong> time -- those precious seconds ticking away on the <em>clock</em>. Remember to always put time over money (in this kanji and in life).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 23-3-2010(13): <strong>Covet</strong>. One can <strong>covet</strong> <em>money</em>. Money can buy a lot but it cannot buy time. Presiding above all, watch the <em>clock</em> ticking... a countdown to one&#039;s grave!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Louismi">Louismi</a>] 2-7-2011(5): Here it shows the two most<strong> covet</strong>ed things. Time and money. You know time is money. Besides people go to work, deceive, kill etc to get money and time goes on top because it&#039;s<strong> covet</strong>ed the most. One would buy time when near death but you can. Many have been looking for the elixir of life but they failed. And they go together because many would despise a life without any money.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 14-9-2012(3): <strong>Covet</strong> <em>time</em> over <em>money</em>, for <em>money</em> cannot buy <em>time</em>, as the <em>clock</em> keeps ticking.
