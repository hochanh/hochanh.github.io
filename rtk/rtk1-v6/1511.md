1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 13-2-2008(328): I bounce down the <em>road</em> on my <em>pogo stick</em>, easily getting through the dense<strong> traffic</strong>. (Note: New primitive: chop-seal + utilize = pogo stick. Because a <em>chop-seal</em> is long and thin with a rubbery bit at the end. If it were big enough, you could <em>utilize</em> it as a <em>pogo stick</em>). [Edit: <em>pogo stick</em> also appears in 1409, 1690, 2530].

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 7-7-2006(45): Building on gorgon&#039;s story I now change mine to a much more silly and rememberable one. The Chinese police is using a helicopter to check and regulate the<strong> traffic</strong>. Hanging from the helicopter is a huge <em>chopseal</em> that they <em>utilize</em> to mark some of the cars that are causing trouble on the <em>road</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stshores24">stshores24</a>] 3-9-2008(22): <strong>MA</strong> （マ） drinks one too many <em>screwdriver</em>s and then drives off down the <em>road</em>. Unfortunately, she&#039;s so inebriated she causes a<strong> traffic</strong> accident.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jotun">jotun</a>] 1-6-2008(12): They have built a new road downtown. It bypasses all the<strong> traffic</strong>. If your papers have been <em>chop seal</em>ed, you can <em>utilize</em> it.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura">vosmiura</a>] 20-11-2007(8): Same as Katsuo, but I remember &quot;utilize&quot; better as &quot;philips screw driver&quot;. A long <em>screw driver</em> with a <em>chop-seal</em> on the end makes an interesting <em>pogo stick</em>.
