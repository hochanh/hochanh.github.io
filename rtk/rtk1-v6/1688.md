1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scout">scout</a>] 9-2-2008(160): They made a <em>metal</em><strong> casting</strong> of the Chinese man who <em>glued</em> <em>shrubs</em> to himself to increase his <em>longevity</em>. It&#039;s now sold around the world as it&#039;s thought that having one will increase your own <em>longevity.</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 18-7-2007(15): I have a problem with <em>longevity</em> so I need <em>Bush</em> in this story too. Here das <em>Bush</em> is wanting a <em>metal</em><strong> casting</strong> made of him to guarantee his <em>longevity</em> - reminds me of the statue of Saddam that was pulled down.
