1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 5-7-2006(390): Of course, <em>trees</em> are <em>anti-</em>plank. Wouldn&#039;t you be if you were a <em>tree</em>?

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 24-6-2006(32): Trees are naturally opposed to, or anti, the making of<strong> plank</strong>s.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zdude255">zdude255</a>] 13-6-2008(22): Trees are definitely anti-plank. They&#039;re even having a protest. Ironically the signs are still made of paper.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 23-12-2007(16): Our <em>anti</em> hero Dirty Harry is having a pirate fantasy about pushing the villain from a <em>tree</em><strong> plank</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pete171">Pete171</a>] 2-10-2008(11): A <strong>plank</strong> of wood is made from <em>trees</em>. Obviously <em>trees</em> are&quot;<em>anti-</em><strong>plank</strong>&quot; since they are cut down and shaped to be made into <strong>planks</strong>. Now imagine a demonstration of anti-<strong>plank</strong> <em>trees</em> protesting against their massacre by grouping together and waving around their campaign slogans in the air on signs. And what are those signs made of out, people? Irony.
