1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 11-1-2007(150): A <em>fathom</em> is the unit you use when making <strong>rules</strong> about <strong>water</strong>&#039;s depth.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/XanthosDeia">XanthosDeia</a>] 13-7-2008(76): You can&#039;t<strong> fathom</strong> how deep this <em>water</em> is. Perhaps you should use a <em>ruler</em> to measure it?

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cornfed">cornfed</a>] 20-1-2008(28): Imagine jumping in the water and riding a shellfish down to the bottom, measuring<strong> fathom</strong>s with your ruler.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anroo">anroo</a>] 15-7-2009(20): <strong>Fathom</strong>s beneath the <em>water</em>, a <em>shellfish</em> defends the depths with his <em>sabre</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 17-10-2009(17): HINT: I find 測 and 則 confusing. For 則 <a href="../v4/88.html">rule</a> (#88 則)Heisig describes the keyword as a rule (regulation). Then in <a href="../v4/149.html">fathom</a> (#149 測) he suggests 則 is a ruler or measure! Whatever stories you choose, don&#039;t loose sight of the meaning: 則 = rule (regulation, law), 測 =<strong> fathom</strong> (measure, conjecture).
