1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 2-9-2007(209): The <em>prostitute</em> carries an old <em>whiskey bottle</em> filled with <strong>acid</strong> to throw at any difficult Johns.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 29-1-2008(113): Dealing <em>alcohol</em> requires a <em>license</em>, dealing<strong> acid</strong> requires fast <em>legs</em> (to run from the police).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Corodon">Corodon</a>] 22-1-2009(71): I stopped doing <strong>acid</strong>, and am living the clean life. Well, aside from all the <em>whiskey</em> and <em>prostitutes</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Copycatken">Copycatken</a>] 8-4-2009(10): The punishment for people who sell <em>whiskey</em> without a <em>license</em> is harsh:<strong> acid</strong> is poured onto their <em>walking legs</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sweetneet">sweetneet</a>] 30-8-2006(9): Sometimes ppl put<strong> acid</strong> into their <em>alcohol</em> to make it taste bad (so you won&#039;t want to drink it anymore). this guy uses this technique to give up drinking <em>alcohol</em>, since due to the number of his DUIs he had gotten his driver&#039;s <em>license</em> suspended and thus must make use of his <em>walking legs</em> (an inconvenience!).
