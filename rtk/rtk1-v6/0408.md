4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/noname">noname</a>] 4-7-2008(36): 定める 【さだめる】 (v1,vt) to decide; to establish; to<strong> determine</strong>; (P)The primitive &quot;mend&quot; is too arbitrary and I can never remember it. New primitive meaning: CORRECT PERSON: Do you see the 4th and 5th stroke? They look like the kanji for &quot;person.&quot; Therefore, CORRECT + PERSON = CORRECT PERSON. STORY: I DECIDED/DETERMINED I would fix my HOUSE this summer but am still looking for the CORRECT PERSON to do it (i.e. a contractor).
