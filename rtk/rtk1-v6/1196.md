1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 10-3-2007(206): A<strong> headland</strong> is a <em>mountain</em> that is firmly <em>rooted</em> despite being surrounded on 3 sides by water. (Just like your head is a mountain surrounded by air on 3 sides, a<strong> headland</strong>!).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matt_jenkins">matt_jenkins</a>] 21-4-2008(125): <strong>Headland</strong>s are natural forts; in fact, once men build castles on them, they become <em>armoured mountains</em>. (Gibralter, for example, is basically an <em>armoured mountain</em>).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 10-11-2008(26): A <em>mountain</em> that has been <em>pushed</em> into the sea.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 7-1-2011(22): The<strong> headland</strong> is <em>mountain</em>ous terrain that provides a natural fortification (or <em>armour</em>) against sea-borne invasion. 岬 (みさき) : cape (on coast).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dilandau23">dilandau23</a>] 9-1-2007(19): Forget confusing the meanings (<strong>headland</strong>, <a href="../v4/778.html">promontory</a> (#778 崎), <a href="../v4/153.html">cape</a> (#153 埼)) they are synonyms, no way around that. Luckily, all three seem to be used in names most. I used: The<strong> headland</strong> or <strong>head</strong> of the <strong>land</strong> is obviously the part of the land that is placed highest, in the same way our head is highest on the body. <em>Mountains</em> are the <strong>head</strong>s of the <strong>land</strong>s they have planted their <em>roots</em> into.
