1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 7-10-2006(184): Mnemonic:<strong> Bundle</strong> of joy. Here I see the proverbial stork with a baby hanging from its <em>mouth</em> fly straight into a <em>tree</em>. Painful, but he doesn&#039;t drop the<strong> bundle</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 13-12-2006(126): Unlike in 杏 , this big mouth isn&#039;t content to wait for apricots to fall in his mouth, so he has climbed the tree and is taking them in<strong> bundle</strong>s.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 9-7-2009(46): A<strong> bundle</strong> of some kind has been stuffed into the <em>opening</em> of a <em>tree</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 24-4-2006(18): This is an image of the monster Gojira (AKA Godzilla) that is so mad it has eaten all the trees. So a<strong> bundle</strong> of trees sticks out of Gojiras mouth as it rampages through Tokyo.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/epangelia2k2">epangelia2k2</a>] 10-6-2008(12): Tip: I was looking for a personification for<strong> bundle</strong> man [+fab] and came across this evocative story from the archives (1889) <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9901E5D9163BE033A25755C2A9659C94689FD7CF">http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9901E5D9163BE033A25755C2A9659C94689FD7CF</a> Caution: the famous vagrant is known as Leather Man so don&#039;t confuse with <a href="../v4/1893.html">leather</a> (#1893 革). But in the end I couldn&#039;t resist both because of the interesting story and the fact one of the possessions found in his mysterious sack (bundle) was an awl as used in subsequent frames 1671-1674!
