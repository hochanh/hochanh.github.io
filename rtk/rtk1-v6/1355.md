1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 6-12-2006(296): A <strong>gorge</strong> is where God has cut into a <em>mountain</em> with a pair of <em>scissors</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 10-2-2007(29): A<strong> gorge</strong> is where God has cut into a <em>mountain</em> with a pair of <em>scissors</em>. Nice pic mspertus!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 1-1-2006(27): A kid cuts a<strong> gorge</strong> into a paper <em>mountain</em>, with a pair of <em>scissors</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shinyclef">shinyclef</a>] 26-5-2009(25): Etymology of right half = 夾 (Type 1 Phonetic) (be pressed between). Interesting? <a href="../v4/1265.html">gorge</a> (#1265 峡) <a href="../v4/1266.html">cramped</a> (#1266 狭) <a href="../v4/1267.html">sandwiched</a> (#1267 挟). Very directly related to the meaning of these three kanji.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 24-7-2008(16): For the radical on the right, I suggest using <em>zipper</em> instead of <em>scissors</em> (chosen by Heisig merely because it slighty looks like one), as I found it made this batch a walk in the park. What&#039;s more humorous than the image of a <em>mountain</em> <strong>gorge</strong> that can be opened or closed at will with a <em>zipper</em>?
