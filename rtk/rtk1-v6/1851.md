1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 14-4-2007(206): The <em>shape</em> of a sheriff&#039;s <em>badge</em> makes it<strong> patent</strong> who he is.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 18-12-2006(36): <em>Mystique</em> the shape-shifter sneaks into the<strong> patent</strong> office easily after she steals an identity <em>badge</em> from a security guard.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 4-8-2007(31): Note: the keyword has nothing to do with trademarks and is to be understood in the sense of a &quot;public recognition&quot;. However the kanji is not common, so getting the exact meaning is not a big deal.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 11-9-2007(30): YOU have the <strong>patent</strong> for <em>Playdoh</em>? That&#039;s <strong>patent</strong>ly false. See here, I have the <em>badge</em> of proof issued from the <strong>patent</strong> office.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 31-3-2008(24): It was<strong> patent</strong>ly absurd when the fellow tried to arrest me--his <em>badge</em> was the wrong <em>shape</em>: a <em>vase</em> and a <em>sunflower</em>? Come now.
