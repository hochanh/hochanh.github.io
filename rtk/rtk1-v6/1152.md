1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PacifistGod">PacifistGod</a>] 8-2-2011(285): A women is so<strong> exhaust</strong>ed by her &quot;shakuhachi&quot; that she needs to ice her jaw.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 27-6-2008(67): <strong>Exhaust</strong> here is like car<strong> exhaust</strong> or using up something such as<strong> exhaust</strong>ing your supplies. So picture a SHAKU-HACHI flute being played in ICE cold temperatures. You&#039;ll see the<strong> EXHAUST</strong> from your breath as it leaves the SHAKU-HACHI flute.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jwy2k2">jwy2k2</a>] 6-5-2007(60): That&#039;s not ice...it&#039;s my last drops and I&#039;m<strong> exhaust</strong>ed! ;).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 13-11-2006(43): This old Japanese man totally<strong> exhaust</strong>ed himself giving a <em>winter</em>-time performance of <em>shakuhachi</em>. That <em>winter</em> was so cold, the <em>shakuhachi</em> was getting clogged with <em>ice</em> as the man was playing. Mnemonic: &quot;<strong>exhaust</strong>ed after playing <em>ice</em>-clogged <em>shakuhachi</em>&quot;. Meanings: to<strong> exhaust</strong>; to be<strong> exhaust</strong>ed; to use up completely; to use (exhaust) all one&#039;s strength (in the performance of one&#039;s duties).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 29-10-2006(27): You can imagine how<strong> exhaust</strong>ing it would be to play a <em>shakuhachi</em> filled with <em>ice</em>. It would<strong> exhaust</strong> your supply of breath (and probably patience).
