1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 18-10-2007(168): The fat <em>king</em> hogs the<strong> whole</strong> space under his <em>umbrella</em>. (tweaked version of radical tyro&#039;s story. &quot;fat&quot; makes a more vivid image for me.).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 20-12-2005(121): The <em>king</em> takes up the<strong> whole</strong> space under his <em>umbrella</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mhheie">mhheie</a>] 4-4-2008(69): King Arthur united the<strong> whole</strong> of England under his umbrella. (The umbrella methophore works pretty good here, due to England&#039;s miserable weather).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/baldy514">baldy514</a>] 3-1-2009(17): You need a king sized umbrella to keep your<strong> whole</strong> body dry.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 4-6-2006(10): This is similar to radical_tyro&#039;s story, but has a few points that help me. Whenever it rains, the <em>king</em> hogs the<strong> whole</strong> <em>umbrella,</em> and we can&#039;t do anything about it (because, after all, he is the <em>king</em>).
