1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/happychair">happychair</a>] 6-3-2006(218): Having decided to use SIGN OF THE HARE rather than RECEIPT and STAMP my mnemonic goes as follows: The<strong> WILLOW</strong> is the TREE that droops likes a HARE&#039;s ears.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wasurenaide">wasurenaide</a>] 14-12-2007(106): A strange thing about the japanese<strong> willow</strong> tree is, it grows eggs... but the eggs have no yokes. weird eh?

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 5-1-2008(51): I ordered a<strong> willow</strong> <em>tree</em> off Amazon but when it arrived it was covered in postage <em>stamps</em>. I try to peel them off but it ends up leaving a papery mess and cheapifies the<strong> willow</strong>&#039;s appearance. Luckily I kept a <em>receipt</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taijuando">taijuando</a>] 16-5-2006(26): At the<strong> Willow</strong> Tree Nursery first you pick up your <em>tree</em> you can leave the lot when you show your <em>receipt</em> .. you also get a <em>stamp</em> for your next purchase.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kfmfe04">kfmfe04</a>] 28-9-2008(15): A<strong> willow</strong> <em>tree</em> looks like it has <em>receipts</em> and <em>stamps</em> hanging off it.
