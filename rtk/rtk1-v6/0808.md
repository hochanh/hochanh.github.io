1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 10-10-2007(65): The secrets of<strong> metallurgy</strong> and smithing: get your redhot metal and bang it against the <em>pedestal</em> as an anvil. Then cool it quickly with lots of <em>ice</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brendanmacdonald">brendanmacdonald</a>] 16-9-2008(30): An ICE PEDESTAL is useless in<strong> METALLURGY</strong> since it will just melt.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wilsoncb">wilsoncb</a>] 22-8-2010(11): I get this confused with all the similar words (forge, tempering, etc.), so I&#039;ll make this metal-allergy. The poor blacksmith&#039;s son, who had no choice but to take up his father&#039;s vocation, spent every day by the pedestal/anvil. Sadly, he had a metal-allergy, so he spent every night putting ICE on his hives...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 30-7-2009(11): One secret used in<strong> metallurgy</strong> is to have a <em>ice pedestal</em>, in case you burn your butt.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 14-2-2007(4): <em>Ice</em> on the <em>pedestal</em> was no longer a problem thanks to the science of<strong> metallurgy</strong>.
