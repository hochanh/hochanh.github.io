1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 19-12-2007(161): Think RPG. The wizard points his <em>finger</em> to the guard and the <em>ivy</em> he has just animated with his <em>magic wand</em> climbs down the wall to <strong>hang</strong> the poor guy, opening the way for the adventurers into the dungeon.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 10-10-2005(105): 3 ways you could<strong> hang</strong> something: 1) the normal way, with your finger putting something on a hook or whatever, 2)<strong> hang</strong>ing from a vine the natural way, or 3) by means of the magic of the wand.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 28-5-2008(82): This kanji depicts 3 different ways to<strong> hang</strong> something: using your <em>fingers</em>, using<strong> hang</strong>ing <em>ivy</em>/rope, or with the flick of a <em>magic wand</em>. (much thanks to Darg Sama!).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Lozza">Lozza</a>] 28-9-2008(44): Naked Tarzan is swinging through the jungle, gripping the ivy with his fingers, his wand<strong> hang</strong>ing out.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 8-8-2009(21): (<strong>Warning</strong> - <em>really</em> grotesque image ahead - <strong>Warning</strong>) Use your <em>fingers</em> to wrap the <em>ivy</em> rope around the convict&#039;s neck, and then see if there is any truth to the story about a man&#039;s, ahem, <em>magic wand</em> becoming swollen when executed by<strong> hang</strong>ing.
