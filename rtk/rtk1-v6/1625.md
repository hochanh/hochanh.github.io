1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 4-7-2007(251): Recall the fashion model wearing just a <em>stamp</em> over his <em>crotch</em> (<a href="../v4/1399.html">clothing</a> (#1399 服)). When he got <em>happy</em>, of course, it ended up in the news<strong> report</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PrettyKitty">PrettyKitty</a>] 30-4-2008(85): On the news: &quot;We are happy to<strong> report</strong> that stamp-sized bikini bottoms are back in style!&quot; (Well, the men are happy about it, at least.).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/happychair">happychair</a>] 14-3-2006(20): The<strong> REPORT</strong> from the doctor made me <em>HAPPY</em> because it said that he had <em>STAMPED</em> out my <em>CROTCH</em> infection.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 1-7-2012(17): &quot;My child&#039;s book<strong> report</strong> got a <em>happy stamp again</em> :-)...&quot; -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (In case you&#039;re wondering, the<strong> report</strong>s to this story are actually for my previous, somewhat obscene story. This story is courtesy of another RTK member (bodhisamaya?), who seems to have deleted it. Hope he/she doesn&#039;t mind.).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yuriehoshii">yuriehoshii</a>] 31-5-2011(14): BÁO : Fashion<strong> REPORT</strong> :new bikini with just a STAMP cover the CROTCH , make men more HAPPY :D !!!
