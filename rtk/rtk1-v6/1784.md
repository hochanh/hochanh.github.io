1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 10-9-2007(239): If your <strong>potato</strong>s are growing <em>flowers</em> and those little <em>hooked roots</em>, you should either buy less or eat them faster.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 3-2-2008(77): If your<strong> potato</strong>es are growing <em>flowers</em>, you need to store them in a more <em>dry</em> place, like hanging them on <em>hooks</em> so they don&#039;t accumulate moisture on the floor.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 4-5-2008(53): Believe it or not, originally the <strong>potato</strong> was cultivated because of its beautiful <em>flowers</em> rather than for eating the actual &quot;<em>potato</em>&quot; below. (historical fact).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 21-1-2006(18): Tip : the bottom primitive (<em>potato with hooks</em>) can be thought of as &quot;Mr<strong> Potato</strong> Head&quot;, the toy patented in 1952 with which you can make faces. This <em>potato</em> has little <em>hooks</em> onto which you can attach ears, noses, glasses, etc. to make all sorts of faces.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Murjab">Murjab</a>] 1-12-2008(10): The<strong> potato</strong> plant consists of both flowers and the root below. The root (the part of a plant that hooks into the soil), is all that most people think of when they hear the word &quot;potato.&quot; Therefore, while the kanji for <strong>potato</strong> contains all parts of the plant - flowers and roots - as a primitive, only focus on the important part - the roots.
