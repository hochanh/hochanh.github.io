1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 16-1-2008(175): Heisig&#039;s stroke order in the 4th edition (and earlier) is wrong, so be careful -- first is the left-most vertical stroke, then draw the rest of the &quot;sun&quot; attachment as you would normally. In fact, if you just wrote it out as two suns with elongated sides, you&#039;ll get the stroke order exactly correct.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus">scottamus</a>] 4-9-2006(56): The<strong> gates</strong> to Hell. guarded by Cerebus or ... Bill<strong> Gates</strong>?

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KristinHolly">KristinHolly</a>] 25-11-2008(23): Bill<strong> Gates</strong> is just about to walk into a saloon.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Howdoken">Howdoken</a>] 11-5-2008(18): The<strong> GATES</strong> of Hell make a great primitive for the following frames.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dustin_Calgary">Dustin_Calgary</a>] 14-1-2009(9): Primitives, Either<strong> gates</strong> to hell, or the pearly<strong> gates</strong> :D.
