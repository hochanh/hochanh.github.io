1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 15-10-2006(178): <strong>Coding</strong> is a <em>tool</em> which you can use to <em>bend</em> the computer to your will.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vileru">vileru</a>] 8-1-2010(75): This kanji means a<strong> code</strong> of law, not a secret language or symbolic language (such as programming<strong> code</strong>) ... Story: The<strong> code</strong> of law is a <em>tool</em> used to <em>bend</em> citizens to society&#039;s will. You can use the image of a totalitarian state, but be careful not to confuse it with the pinnacle primitive <a href="../v4/1294.html">Heights</a> (#1294 阪).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 8-7-2008(60): Think &quot;codex&quot; (mnemonic help) or &quot;code of laws&quot;, or even Leonardo Da Vinci&#039;s<strong> code</strong>. Here I see a<strong> code</strong>x as a <em>tool</em> used to <em>bend</em> the masses into submission. Picture a huge<strong> code</strong>x book lifted down on crowds to bend them down in submission. Another: if you <em>bend</em> to the<strong> code</strong> without asking questions, you are a <em>tool</em>!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jotun">jotun</a>] 8-7-2008(23): Bender can be used as a tool for bending. But only if you know the right<strong> code</strong> (He never does want you want to).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tristanthorn">tristanthorn</a>] 18-3-2009(20): <strong>Code</strong>/<strong>rules</strong> can be <em>bent</em> with the correct <em>tool</em>... (usually money).
