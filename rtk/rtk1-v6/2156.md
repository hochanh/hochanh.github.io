1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 3-11-2006(150): Picture an ad in which Uncle Jimbo (of &quot;South Park&quot; fame)<strong> recommend</strong>s the latest craze in deer hunting : a high tech <em>slingshot</em>! The ad begins with Bambi prancing around, smelling the <em>flowers</em>. Then, all of a sudden, Bambi is brutally murdered with the <em>slingshot</em>, put on the <em>cooking fire</em>, and the camera pans to Uncle Jimbo happily munching on crispy cooked Bambi! Note: the <em>slingshot</em> is strokes 11-12.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 7-1-2007(142): It is<strong> recommend</strong>ed that deers stick to eating flowers. If they try to eat birds, they may end up choking on them, like this one here. Note that the head ( 白 ) is gone and the visible part of the body which is normally written with a stroke of the head must by necessity be drawn with a stroke of the tail.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/javiergakusei">javiergakusei</a>] 4-11-2007(102): For tonight&#039;s dinner (says the waiter) I would<strong> recommend</strong> the Deer. It is very special because it has been fed with flowers all it&#039;s life, has been killed with a slingshot (so there is no gun powder in it) and right now it is in the cooking fire. The meaning:<strong> recommend</strong>; mat; advise; encourage; offer.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/errtu">errtu</a>] 4-5-2010(67): Wow 2000 baby, almost there doubly happy now.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gdaxeman">gdaxeman</a>] 16-1-2008(36): One deer hunter to another: &quot;I <strong>recommend</strong> you to use <em>flowers</em> to attract the <em>deer</em> then use a <em>slingshot</em> to fire <em>tail feathers</em> at it&quot;.
