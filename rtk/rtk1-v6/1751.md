1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 6-3-2007(182): The <em>gates</em> are too big to be <strong>closed</strong> by man. Only a <em>genie</em> can. &quot;Close sesame!&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 27-9-2008(89): You hear <em>lesbians</em> moaning &quot;オォ~&quot; from behind<strong> closed</strong> <em>gates</em>, and you ask a <em>genius</em> how to get in there.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nmkohi">nmkohi</a>] 23-7-2006(29): Bill GATES keeps his operating system<strong> CLOSED</strong>, does that make him a GENIUS? I think not.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 26-10-2005(19): A <em>genie</em> is making sure that the gates of Ali Baba&#039;s Cave are always <em>closed</em>. Picture the genie (who lives in an oil lamp in that cave) grumbling about how Ali Baba is so forgetful, and that it&#039;s always him, the genie who has to check that the gates are<strong> closed</strong>. See previous frame 1622 &quot;open&quot;. -- Note : I don&#039;t worry about the keyword &quot;cave&quot; here because you can&#039;t have the &quot;cave&quot; enclosure within the same kanji as the &quot;gates&quot; enclosure.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 16-9-2009(17): &quot;オー no! I stayed out past curfew, and now the gate has been<strong> closed</strong>!&quot;.
