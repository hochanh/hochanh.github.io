1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 12-9-2007(62): Call your friend and he answers the phone &quot;Mochi,<strong> mochi</strong>!&quot; whatever he is <em>eating</em> sure is making it hard to understand. I will <em>puzzle</em> over the content of our conversation for some time to come.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 30-7-2009(18): <strong>Mochi</strong> is like a <em>puzzle</em> you <em>eat</em> and solve in your mouth lest you choke.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 14-12-2008(15): <strong>Mochi</strong> ice cream is a puzzling food, I still have no idea how they get that ice cream in there, but it sure tastes good.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 15-1-2010(13): <strong>MOCHI</strong> is so difficult to EAT, it&#039;s a PUZZLE to me why people eat it.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 21-6-2010(9): As a promotion, a<strong> MOCHI</strong> manufacturer starts making them as pieces of a jigsaw. Now kids want to buy them not to eat them, but to solve the week&#039;s <em>FOOD PUZZLE</em>!
