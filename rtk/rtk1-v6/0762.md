1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 6-2-2007(174): Well, you usually use your <em>fingers</em> to<strong> throw</strong> objects used as <em>missile</em> weapons. Easy. By the way, for those of you looking for a less anachronistic image for the <em>missile</em> primitive as a modern rocket, try a slingshot. it&#039;s a <em>crotch</em> (originally a tree branch) that sends missile projectiles flying into/like the <em>wind</em>. And for this present kanji, it is something you naturally use with your fingers...
