1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 15-5-2007(218): My <em>stones</em> are so huge that it takes <em>two hands</em> to<strong> polish</strong> them!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PacifistGod">PacifistGod</a>] 30-1-2007(184): You use two hands to<strong> polish</strong> a stone: one to hold it and the other to rub it.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wazzab">wazzab</a>] 18-2-2007(37): Scene from Karate Kid: Wax on (with one hand), wax off (with the other). But instead of using cloth he&#039;s using stones in his hand.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 16-9-2009(23): Cinderella <strong>polishing</strong> the <em>stone</em> floor with <em>both hands</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Green_Airplane">Green_Airplane</a>] 6-3-2010(15): To<strong> polish</strong> a katana you need two things: finest grade of <strong>polishing</strong> <em>stones</em>, and of course <em>two hands</em>. If you accidentally chop one off, your career as sword<strong> polish</strong>er is over. (once again I&#039;m using this to remember the order of the elements - first stone, then two hands).
