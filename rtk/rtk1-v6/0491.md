1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Francois">Francois</a>] 1-4-2008(185): If you have a <em>siesta</em> with your <em>mouth</em>open, you will wake up with a<strong> hoarse</strong> voice.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu">nolusu</a>] 17-7-2007(27): After taking a siesta, you find that your mouth is<strong> hoarse</strong> (after all you ARE thirsty remember).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zodiac">zodiac</a>] 31-10-2008(25): When you are<strong> hoarse</strong>, it&#039;s time for your <em>mouth</em> to have a <em>siesta</em>. (I don&#039;t like relating this to thirst, mixed them up a few times).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Istvan">Istvan</a>] 13-6-2007(10): Cheech&#039;s voice is always<strong> hoarse</strong>. Cheech, &quot;Hey man you seen what happened to my mouth man? I can&#039;t talk right man.&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stevieman">Stevieman</a>] 19-3-2010(9): If you break up SIESTA into <em>tongue wagging in mouth</em>, <em>bound up</em>, <em>sitting man</em>, you have somewhat the image of a prisoner begging. This gives you the general sense of <em>BEGGAR</em>. Using <em>BEGGAR</em> as a primitive is better I think. A <a href="../v4/451.html">thirst</a> (#451 渇) beggar begs for water. A beggar speaks requesting an <a href="../v4/452.html">audience</a> (#452 謁)(to beg for money), a beggar&#039;s garments are usually <a href="../v4/453.html">brown</a> (#453 褐)(dirty), and <em>BEGGARS SLEEP</em> so much when they open their <em>MOUTH</em>, their voice is<strong> hoarse</strong>. (btw, chinese etymology: the bottom part of siesta means to beg).
