1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 15-10-2007(260): The<strong> juvenile</strong> stood on top of his computer and broke it. Noob.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 16-1-2008(39): The movie Zoolander is a little<strong> JUVENILE</strong> and silly, but I love it nonetheless. Just remember Owen Wilson <em>standing</em> on the desk, hitting the <em>computer</em> like a monkey. (The files are IN the computer - IN the computer...).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 22-12-2007(29): This one is really easy if you gave <a href="../v4/173.html">ri</a> (#173 里) the meaning &quot;House of the Fathers&quot;. Most <strong>juvenile</strong> people <em>stand</em> on the <em>house of their fathers</em>, because they can&#039;t yet afford their own house.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 22-10-2009(15): Watch this<strong> juvenile</strong> at youtube and you will not forget the<strong> juvenile</strong> <em>standing</em> on <em>the computer</em>! (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwOv0xg31nk&amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwOv0xg31nk&amp;feature=related</a>; or search: &quot;angry German kid&quot;).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/slats70">slats70</a>] 9-10-2008(11): <strong>Juvenile</strong> stands up in from of the computer so you cant see the porn hes looking at.
