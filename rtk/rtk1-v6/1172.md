1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 11-9-2007(184): And in front of every <em>altar</em>, she <em>stopped</em> to pray for the<strong> welfare</strong> of the others.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 7-3-2007(161): Religious Republicans regularly go to the <em>altar</em> to pray for a <em>stop</em> to<strong> welfare</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jimsublimeman">jimsublimeman</a>] 6-5-2008(74): I pray at the <em>altar</em> everyday that they don&#039;t <em>stop</em> my<strong> welfare</strong> checks. (A quick mnemonic is better for this one).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/peacemik">peacemik</a>] 2-7-2008(37): Marxist belief: To improve general<strong> welfare</strong>, the influence of the <em>altar</em> must be <em>stop</em>ped. Maybe the Marxists had a point.... (Mnemonic:<strong> Welfare</strong> = <em>Stop</em> the <em>altar</em>) 福祉 (ふくし):<strong> welfare</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 29-12-2007(19): I remember this one with a political idea ... don&#039;t read if you&#039;re easily offended. Ironically, many of the people on<strong> Welfare</strong> in the USA are the super-religious type (the sort that regularly visit their respective <em>altars</em>) in the American South, and tend to all have that infamous <em>&quot;Footprints&quot;</em> poem (where God carries you across the beach) hanging in their living rooms. These people tend to vote conservatively (politicians that oppose federal<strong> welfare</strong>), and thus ... against their own best interests.
