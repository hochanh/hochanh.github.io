1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taijuando">taijuando</a>] 4-4-2006(401): There are different<strong> cereals</strong> in different parts of the world. Japan has <em>samurai</em> cereal. Great Britain has <em>Crowned Wheat</em> ... the United States and Russia have <em>Missile</em><strong> cereals</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 4-11-2007(165): The <em>samurai crowns wheat</em> as the best <strong>cereal</strong>, and blows all others up with <em>missiles</em> (he&#039;s a <strong>cereal</strong> killer).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 29-12-2008(95): <strong>Hint</strong>: I think<strong> cereals</strong> should be studied with <a href="../v4/710.html">husk</a> (#710 殻) because the difference between the husk and cereal is what&#039;s inside, would it be <em>wheat</em> or air (<em>wind</em>)! <strong>Story</strong>:<strong> cereals</strong> are similar to <a href="../v4/710.html">husk</a> (#710 殻) only that the <em>husk</em>s can be carried by the <em>wind</em> because they don&#039;t have a <em>wheat</em> grain!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(23): A pack of<strong> cereals</strong> (i.e. cornflakes) contains a plastic samurai (toy) with a crown and missile (i..e a rocket launcher on its shoulder).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 20-4-2008(15): Japan has <em>samurai</em> cereal. Great Britain has <em>Crowned Wheat</em> ... the United States and Russia have <em>Missile</em><strong> cereals</strong> (hey, what do you think they keep in those silos?).
