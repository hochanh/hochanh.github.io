1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/desmidus">desmidus</a>] 4-2-2008(413): The 69 position allows both parties to<strong> mutually</strong> give themselves pleasure.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 4-9-2007(37): If you can combined your <em>walls</em> with another house&#039;s <em>walls</em>, both houses would<strong> mutually</strong> benefit, by the increase in size....

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FoxintheStars">FoxintheStars</a>] 20-8-2010(16): <strong>Mutually</strong> means &quot;You and You together&quot;---two katakana ユ (yu)s interlocking top and bottom.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama">liosama</a>] 4-12-2008(16): It feels better to imagine two elbows linked together in mutuality.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(10): Pictograph, see book. To me this kanji looks like the T and L of<strong> mutually</strong> (in the first two strokes) mirrored upside-down just like the King/Queen/Valet of a card game. The two L&#039;s of<strong> mutually</strong> are there to remind you the pair of TL&#039;s are<strong> mutually</strong> joined by the L&#039;s (i.e. “two times T and L, joined by the L&#039;s”).
