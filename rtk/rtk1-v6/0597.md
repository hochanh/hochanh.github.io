1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 17-11-2009(59): This is the kanji for the shii <em>tree</em>, on which shiitake ( 椎茸 ) mushrooms grow. It&#039;s easy to picture a <em>turkey</em> dropping by the shii <em>tree</em> to gobble down some of those <strong>sweet oaky</strong> (shiitake) mushrooms.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 13-6-2007(31): Why is the<strong> sweet oak</strong> so sweet? Not sure, but to me it tastes just like <em>turkey</em> (with gravy and cranberry sauce!) Now that is sweet.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum">oregum</a>] 22-12-2011(15): I always use<strong> SWEET OAK</strong> WOOD to add flavor to roasted TURKEY.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 8-11-2010(4): 無脊椎動物 , 脊椎動物 , 脊椎 , 椎骨 , 椎骨 , 椎茸 , <a href="../v4/2505.html">sweet oak</a> (#2505 椎) ツイ,しい ... Tree now written ツイ. Used for <strong>Spine</strong>脊椎, and Shiitake 椎茸 . Replacing the key word to <strong>Spine</strong> ( お風呂 <a href="../v4/24.html">spine</a> (#24 呂) is a phonetic only character), remember the 仙台 hermits we 催す <a href="../v4/987.html">sponsor</a> (#987 催) &#039;d? Well we got them out of the <em>mountains</em> and then we got the <em>Mountains</em> out of them by telling them to get a <strong>Spine</strong> and got a job. (mnemonic 2: Oak is Sweeter than Shiit~ake).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 22-3-2007(4): The <em>turkey</em> liked to search for food under the<strong> sweet oak</strong> <em>tree</em>, believing that sweet grains would grow there.
