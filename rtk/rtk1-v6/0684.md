1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 7-9-2007(229): Hawaii is a little drop of <em>heaven</em> nestled in the <em>waters</em> of the Pacific, most often visited by honeymooners and valentines. It was<strong> annexed</strong> to the U.S.A. in 1959, and more recently to Japan as well-- albeit only unofficially, and through private commercial holdings.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 6-11-2009(95): Tip 1: 天 and 夭 (<em>heavens</em> and <em>sapling</em>) are different, but RTK confuses them. Sapling appears in numbers 634, 938, 2078, 2079, 2080, and all characters containing <em>angel</em> 喬 (429, 430, 1221, 2104, 2120, 2369). Tip 2: The kanji 添 means &quot;something added/attached&quot;, so think of it as a building annex. Story: While in the <strong>Annex</strong> <em>water</em>ing <em>saplings</em>, you find a <em>valentine card</em> amongst them – addressed to you!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu">ruisu</a>] 3-3-2008(60): He drank all the holy water, so god<strong> annexed</strong> his heart to heaven.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ceryn">Ceryn</a>] 9-5-2008(51): First learn 忝 【ＧＲＡＴＥＦＵＬ】 (I was very GRATEFUL to have recieved a VALENTINE straight from HEAVEN.) It&#039;s a rare kanji used in かたじけない which means grateful. Then 添 【ＡＮＮＥＸＥＤ】 (You should be GRATEFUL the city just<strong> ANNEXED</strong> some land and is building a new WATER park.).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 21-3-2008(47): You shed tears (<em>water</em>) as your departed <em>valentine</em> is <strong>annexed</strong> to the <em>heavens</em>.
