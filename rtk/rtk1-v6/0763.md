1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 18-2-2007(267): (Note: this kanji is more collapse/cave-in/<a href="../v4/1888.html">sink</a> (#1888 沈) than humans<strong> drown</strong>ing) A <em>water missile</em>? A torpedo! And when it hits it&#039;s target? The ship <em>collapses</em> then <em>sinks</em> and everyone<strong> drown</strong>s!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/calittle">calittle</a>] 6-10-2007(54): The submarine&#039;s hull was breached after being struck by a torpedo (&quot;<em>water missile</em>&quot;), causing the entire crew to<strong> drown</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tornadic_Indignation">Tornadic_Indignation</a>] 5-5-2009(48): I made her<strong> drown</strong> in my in my <em>semen</em>, which was coming down on her like buckets of <em>water</em>. (applying crystal&#039;s perfect primitive element).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama">MeisterLlama</a>] 29-11-2008(29): I give this Kanji the keyword <strong>go down</strong> (in the sense of something plummeting or going down badly, not in the sense of descending, which is already used) because it is used in sinking ( 沈没 ), dying ( 戦没 ), and sunset ( 日没 ). It seems to me 溺 is the character for<strong> drown</strong>, and in fact it is given the keyword &quot;drowning&quot; later, which is just confusing to me. Story: The ship is <strong>going down</strong>! We were hit by a <em>water</em> <em>missile</em> (a torpedo).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Captain+Kanjipants">Captain+Kanjipants</a>] 6-2-2010(13): When a torpedo (<em>water missile</em>) hits its target, everyone<strong> drown</strong>s!
