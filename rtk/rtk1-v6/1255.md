5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nick65765">Nick65765</a>] 7-6-2012(14): I cant believe i didnt see this before .............................................................. ITS A PICTOGRAPH OF A<strong> TOOTH</strong>!!! ...a front<strong> tooth</strong> thats <em>white as rice</em>, wedged into the <em>upper gum to stop it</em> moving and the <em>shovel primitive is the shape of the<strong> tooth</strong></em>. ...you dont need much imagination to picture this!!........UPDATE: the stop primitive can even mean <em>foot</em> of the<strong> tooth</strong> (like opposite to head) thus root of the<strong> tooth</strong>.
