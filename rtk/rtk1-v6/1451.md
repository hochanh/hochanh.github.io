1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 25-1-2008(168): Ok, here, you have to think of the phrase &quot;TIE the knot&quot; , which means a wedding (this kanji is used in the marriage compound 結婚 けっこん ). Now, at US weddings, it ends with the couple driving away with cans being dragged behind the car. So here, think of SPIDERMAN, who will<strong> TIE</strong> the knot with Mary Jane. At his wedding, Spider THREAD attached (or<strong> TIE</strong>D) to SPRAYCANS are being drug behind the limo as they drive off.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kieron">Kieron</a>] 7-4-2008(126): <em>Spidey</em> <strong>ties</strong> up the villain in a web of <em>threads</em>. &quot;<em>Good luck</em> getting out of that, heh heh!&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura">vosmiura</a>] 15-11-2007(85): <em>Spiderman</em> and a fan have a competition to see who can<strong> tie</strong> up the most enemies fastest. Spidey&#039;s using his webs and the fan is using an <em>aerosol can</em> of silly string. So far they are <strong>tie</strong>d.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 16-10-2009(31): I&#039;m wearing my <em>Spiderman</em><strong> tie</strong> today for <em>good luck</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 19-12-2007(23): I&#039;m pretty bad with knots. The only way I&#039;m ever going to<strong> tie</strong> this <em>thread</em> is if I have <em>good luck</em>!
