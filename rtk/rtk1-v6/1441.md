1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 30-5-2007(139): Hey, <em>Spidey</em>! Eat that <em>turkey</em> if you want, but make sure you eat some<strong> fiber</strong>s: you want spidey <em>threads</em>, don&#039;t ya?

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 28-5-2007(88): If you want to increase your<strong> fiber</strong> intake, just leave on those <em>threads</em> that are used to sew up the stuffed <em>turkey</em> and eat them too.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 26-1-2008(32): When <em>Spider-Man</em> first made his suit, he was so fixated on the textile aspect, on making sure all of the <strong>fibres</strong> were sturdy, he didn&#039;t realize till he finished that he&#039;d made it with a <em>turkey</em> design on the chest instead of a spider. He felt like a real <em>turkey</em> then (that&#039;s the sort of campy insult he might use).
