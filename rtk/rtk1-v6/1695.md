1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 26-4-2007(213): To join the temple, you have to <strong>dedicate</strong> yourself to raising <em>bonsai</em> for enlightenment, and <em>cornstalks</em> for sustenance.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 23-4-2006(61): A Japanese farmer who was growing <em>corn</em> tried to<strong> dedicate</strong> himself to the god of <em>corn</em> (in the hope it would bring better harvests). He had a little room with prayer beads, incense, etc. One day he brought an offerand that he thought would please the god of <em>corn</em> : a <em>bonsai - corn</em> (a <em>corn</em> plant turned into a <em>bonsai</em>). The god was infuriated and yelled at him &quot;HOW DARE YOU TORTURE MY CORN IN SUCH WAYS!&quot;. The End.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 8-12-2008(42): I used <em>does not equal</em> for the primitve(slant the line as a slash through the &quot;equals&quot; sign). Story: Decorating a <em>bonsai tree</em> for Christmas <em>does not equal</em> an <strong>observance</strong> of the real meaning of Christmas. Just like most people who<strong> dedicate</strong> themselves to appeasing the Credit Card gods for Christmas. Just <em>dosen&#039;t equal</em> the Christmas I know of.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/drivers99">drivers99</a>] 14-8-2009(34): You have to be really<strong> dedicate</strong>d to make a <em>bonsai tree</em> out of a <em>cornstalk</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 11-4-2007(16): Once a year, the Japanese decorate bonsai trees with miniature cornstalks, and<strong> dedicate</strong> them to the Ainu, the indigenous people of Japan. (For the record, I completely made that up, and I don&#039;t think corn has anything to do with Ainu, except that it reminds me of natives).
