1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 12-9-2007(130): I have an informed<strong> guess</strong> about whose <em>house</em> the dark <em>rituals</em> are performet at.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 28-7-2007(72): Police ( 警察 ）drive around a street at night trying to<strong> guess</strong> whose house is having a matsuri indoors after complaints from the neighbours.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MethodGT">MethodGT</a>] 14-4-2008(51): For our child&#039;s circumcision (the <em>ritual</em>) we invited a rabbi to our <em>house</em>. We didn&#039;t know it at the time, but he was blind, and he had to<strong> guess</strong> which little squishy thing was the baby&#039;s penis.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pandawhipped">pandawhipped</a>] 10-3-2008(21): The POLICE had enough evidence, so they were able to make an informed<strong> GUESS</strong> as to which HOUSE the dark RITUALS were being performed in.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alunalun">Alunalun</a>] 20-7-2009(14): In our <em>house</em> we have a <em>ritual</em>. When something happens someone says &quot;Guess what happened.&quot; We ask for some sort of vague hint, but get &quot;no, go on,<strong> guess</strong>!&quot; Asking what sort of thing it&#039;s about, news, music, catastrophe, just gets &quot;no, you have to<strong> guess</strong>&quot;. It takes quite a long time to find out what&#039;s happened. It&#039;s a very annoying ritual.
