1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laner36">laner36</a>] 3-10-2007(314): [akrodha] My comb is rust-proof, water-proof, and fire-proof. But unfortunately it is not idiot-proof--and I glued it to myself.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 3-2-2007(91): I spent $100 recently on this excellent rust-proof, water-proof, fire-proof comb. But two days after having bought it, I left it in my back pocket and sat down, snapping this expensive comb in half! I glued it back together, but now every time I try to comb through my thick hair, it just breaks apart again. I guess my comb is also glue-proof.
