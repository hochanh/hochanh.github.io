1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew">Matthew</a>] 6-4-2007(189): A <strong>ghost</strong>, or <strong>oni</strong>, wandering slowly on its <em>human legs</em>, searching for <em>brains</em> to eat. What looks like an <em>elbow</em> here is actually a pictoral representation of the <em>forked tail</em> protruding out of its rear.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 18-11-2006(95): <strong>Ghost</strong>s aren&#039;t very intelligent - they have but a <em>drop</em> of <em>brains</em> - so can&#039;t tell the difference between an <em>elbow</em> and a pair of <em>human legs</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FudoMyo">FudoMyo</a>] 7-11-2007(69): Building on Matthew&#039;s excellent image, the <em>drop</em> can be the single horn sticking out of the <strong>oni</strong>&#039;s forehead.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 8-1-2007(49): 鬼 (おに) is not a<strong> ghost</strong>. An ogre or a troll would be a more fitting translation. Such a thing has but a drop of brains and uses its legs and elbows as deadly weapons (a concept which should be familiar from the <a href="../v4/765.html">license</a> (#765 允) to kill). I&#039;ll use &quot;ogre&quot; for this.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 3-11-2008(22): This<strong> ghost</strong> had only a <em>drop of brains</em>, his <em>legs</em> and <em>elbow</em> were easily visible from under his sheet.
