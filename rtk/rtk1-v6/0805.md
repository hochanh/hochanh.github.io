2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 12-11-2006(160): After training your whole life, you manage to get a bronze medal in the Olympics. You&#039;re extremely proud of your accomplishment as you step up to receive your medal. The guy in first place is up on a<strong> pedestal</strong>, towering above you, his elbow level with your mouth. Being a smug bastard, he &quot;accidentally&quot; knocks his elbow into your mouth, causing you to bleed and lose a tooth. Just cause he won the gold doesn&#039;t mean he can place himself on such a high<strong> pedestal</strong> and do whatever he wants!
