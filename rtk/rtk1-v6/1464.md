1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django">Django</a>] 19-9-2007(160): (dingomick) <em>Venom</em> is upset because Spidey is just that much brainier than he is! He chooses to<strong> accumulate</strong> as many <em>brains</em> as he can, snatching them out of people&#039;s heads and storing them on top of his own, till there&#039;s just one massive <em>brain</em> on top of his head!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Mighty_Matt">Mighty_Matt</a>] 22-2-2008(140): When you<strong> accumulate</strong> knowledge in your <em>brain</em>, neural pathways are constructed. All those pathways end up like a huge ball of <em>thread</em> tangled together. The more knowledge you<strong> accumulate</strong> the more <em>threads</em> you throw into the mix!!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/billyclyde">billyclyde</a>] 23-8-2007(63): Like a jellyfish, a floating BRAIN<strong> accumulate</strong>s THREADS beneath it-- a weird collection.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jaresty">jaresty</a>] 14-11-2007(55): <em>Venom</em> is accumulating <em>brains</em> (much like Sylar in Heroes).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 6-1-2008(21): I found billyclyde&#039;s a bit abstract so I picture a <em>brain</em> rolling about the floor, accumulating <em>threads</em> scattered around and getting bigger as it rolls. (this is easy if you&#039;ve played Katamari).
