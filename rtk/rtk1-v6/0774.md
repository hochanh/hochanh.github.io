1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 25-2-2007(167): Fact: this kanji is used to denote a certain class of vehicles in Japan whose engines are under a certain size (less than 750cc I think) and are called <strong>light</strong> vehicles here. Imagine a so-called <strong>light</strong> vehicle or a <strong>light</strong>-truck with a load of <em>spools</em> driving down a road ever so<strong> lightly</strong>, careful not to let any of the <em>spools</em> roll out onto the street.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paddy71">paddy71</a>] 2-2-2008(119): I want to tread<strong> lightly</strong> on the environment.... That&#039;s why I CAR-SPOOL to work everyday.... I know, lame.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 18-2-2008(94): Suggestion: Replace &quot;spool&quot; with &quot;toilet paper/roll&quot;. Reason: See my note at <a href="../v4/715.html">stalk</a> (#715 茎). Story: You are fussy about your <em>car</em> and to clean it you will only dab it very<strong> lightly</strong> with <em>toilet paper</em>. Spool also appears in <a href="../v4/715.html">stalk</a> (#715 茎), <a href="../v4/716.html">suspicious</a> (#716 怪), <a href="../v4/882.html">diameter</a> (#882 径), <a href="../v4/1360.html">sutra</a> (#1360 経).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 28-7-2008(56): I&#039;m such an infamously bad driver, even if I press the car&#039;s gas peddle<strong> lightly</strong>, everyone soils their pants.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 19-11-2008(21): Car made out of toilet paper would be very light.
