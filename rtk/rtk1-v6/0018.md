1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 21-7-2007(283): Don&#039;t look at the sun directly with your eyes, it&#039;s<strong> risk</strong>y!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/godcomplex">godcomplex</a>] 2-11-2007(55): You&#039;ll<strong> risk</strong> your eyesight if you look up at the sun.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laner36">laner36</a>] 19-5-2008(31): Looking up at the big sun is a<strong> risk</strong> to your eye. To remember that the sun primitive is bigger than the eye primitive, imagine making your eyes little (squinting) when you go out in the bright sun to reduce the<strong> risk</strong> of getting sun blindness. READING: imagine a kid saying &quot;oh that&#039;s ぼう (bull as in B.S.), looking at the sun is no<strong> risk</strong>!&quot; [he&#039;s blind now].

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cerulean">cerulean</a>] 19-5-2008(14): Staring into the big <em>sun</em> can<strong> risk</strong> your <em>eye</em>sight! HINT: It looks like a pipe from Super Mario Bros. It might be<strong> risk</strong>y to go down it. :p.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne">sethimayne</a>] 25-9-2007(10): If you look at the <em>sun</em> high in the sky directly with your <em>eyes</em> below, you&#039;re taking a big<strong> risk</strong>.
