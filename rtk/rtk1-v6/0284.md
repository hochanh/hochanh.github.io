1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne">sethimayne</a>] 22-10-2007(196): A<strong> lord</strong> is a little <em>drop</em> down from <em>King</em> in hierarchy.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spoonz">Spoonz</a>] 15-2-2009(79): A<strong> lord</strong> only has a drop of the king&#039;s power.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Murjab">Murjab</a>] 20-9-2007(28): Although this kanji&#039;s meaning hasn&#039;t caused me much trouble, I&#039;ve had problems remembering the direction of the <em>drop</em> above <em>king</em>, since <em>drops</em> at tops of kanji often seem to appear in different directions. To remember this one, I think of the placement of the <em>drop</em> in <em>jewel</em> (#256 玉). Both of them use the <em>king</em> primitive and include a short <em>drop</em> stroke going from the top left to bottom right.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/trevlaw">trevlaw</a>] 8-11-2008(23): Oh<strong> lord</strong>! someone spat on the king.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MidoriTori">MidoriTori</a>] 7-8-2009(10): The<strong> lord</strong> wants to DROP something on the KING&#039;S head so he can become king himself.
