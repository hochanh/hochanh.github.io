1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fiminor">fiminor</a>] 17-7-2006(280): Wasn&#039;t it a cursed<strong> spindle</strong> that Sleeping Beauty pricked her finger on? Therefore the<strong> spindle</strong> was the <em>metal</em> that caused her to <em>droop</em> and eventually sleep for 100 years.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Avispa">Avispa</a>] 10-10-2007(61): <strong>Spindle</strong>: the needle that drops on an LP record player. This is made of metal. It droops. Viola.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 6-9-2007(51): Think of a <strong>plumb bob</strong> rather than <strong>spindle</strong> (which are the same shape, and this kanji means both). It&#039;s a perfectly literal kanji: <em>droop</em>ing <em>metal</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elmaestrokgb">elmaestrokgb</a>] 20-7-2009(16): Once people could buy whole<strong> spindle</strong>s of CD-Roms for a few bucks, the number of <em>gold</em> records really started to <em>droop</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 8-2-2007(6): I love this one! It&#039;s a classic cartoon episode! The theiving wolf takes the <em>golden</em> <strong>spindle</strong>. Then <em>Droopy Dog</em> takes the <strong>spindle</strong> away from him, thwaks him on the head with it and rolls him up on it.
