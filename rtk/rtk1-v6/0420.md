1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 8-1-2008(207): <strong>Nativity</strong> = born, being born. Think of <strong>birth</strong> as a painful and <em>prolong</em>ed event. And of course, all the <em>words</em> and curses being yelled at the soon-to-be father for doing this to her!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 15-6-2009(173): When you are being born ( <strong>nativity</strong> ), your mother&#039;s WORDS are PROLONGED. (Thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis huuuuuuuuuuuuuurtss a lottttttttt~!! Owwwwwww!!!).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63">ashman63</a>] 7-4-2008(105): The<strong> nativity</strong> story: A child born to a virgin mother? Sounds to me like the <em>words</em> have <em>stretch</em>ed what is sensibly <em>correct</em>. Sadly, those <em>words</em> have continued to be spread through the <em>prolonged</em> use of the bible.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/javiergakusei">javiergakusei</a>] 17-4-2007(61): At<strong> Nativity</strong> (christmas), the priest says more Words (sermon) than the rest of the time, Prolonging mass duration.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/noname">noname</a>] 16-6-2008(34): 誕生日 【たんじょうび】 (n) birthday; (P) 誕生石 【たんじょうせき】 (n) a birthstone STORY: On your BIRTHDAY people say WORDS of good luck and fortune to PROLONG your life.
