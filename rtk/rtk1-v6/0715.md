1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 28-4-2006(242): A military leader in his chariot is<strong> brandish</strong>ing his finger at the enemy, crying &quot;chaaaaaaaaarrrgggeeee!&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skinnyneo">skinnyneo</a>] 27-9-2007(99): Think of the movie Gladiator but instead Maximus is<strong> brandish</strong>ing a giant foam brand name (nike, rebok, adidas, whatever) <em>finger</em> like you see at a baseball game. He&#039;s riding in a <em>chariot</em> using the foam <em>finger</em> to kill his enemy.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yukkuri_kame">yukkuri_kame</a>] 23-7-2009(41): キ　Before the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, the French threatened to cut off the middle finger of all captured Englishmen. Without the middle finger it would be impossible to draw the renowned English longbow. The longbow was made from the English Yew tree. Drawing the longbow was known as &quot;plucking the yew&quot;. The English won, and have since taunted the French. Here is the English &quot;ARMY&quot;<strong> BRANDISH</strong>ING the FINGER saying &quot;pluck yew!&quot; The reading is ふるうwhich seems not so far off from F.U.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeelonghellswan">thegeelonghellswan</a>] 21-9-2008(12): You<strong> brandish</strong> your middle finger at the enemy as you roll through the hood in your chariot... that&#039;s how I roll!
