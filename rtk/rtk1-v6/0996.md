1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 22-3-2007(300): <strong>Chrysanthemum</strong> <em>flower</em> consists of many tiny petals, just like many <em>rice</em> grains <em>bound up</em> together.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 5-9-2007(58): [+astgt]<strong> Chrysanthemum</strong> is a terrorist orginization whose sole objective is to tie up <em>Condi Rice</em>. One day, <em>Condi Rice</em> is standing outside when a group of<strong> chrysanthemum</strong> agents swoop in from the sides, <em>bound</em> her up with<strong> chrysanthemum</strong> rope, and dash off. They leave a lone yellow<strong> chrysanthemum</strong> flower on top of the <em>bound</em> <em>Condi Rice</em> as a sign to let her discoverers know who committed this brave and noble act.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 27-11-2008(39): History: “Around the 8th century A.D., the<strong> chrysanthemum</strong> appeared in Japan. So taken were the Japanese with this flower that they adopted a single flowered<strong> chrysanthemum</strong> as the crest and official seal of the Emperor. Japan also has a National<strong> Chrysanthemum</strong> Day, which is called the Festival of Happiness.” Mnemonic: <em>flower</em> that looks like a lot of <em>grains</em> <em>bound</em> together.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 21-4-2008(20): <strong>Chrysanthemum</strong> is a <em>flower</em> that is as intimately <em>bound up</em> with Japan as gohan.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hyreia">Hyreia</a>] 11-3-2009(16): I&#039;m not a florist, I had to see what a<strong> chrysanthemum</strong> looked like: <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/73/IMG_2967.JPG">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/73/IMG_2967.JPG</a> And I&#039;m happy with what I see. The pistils(?) in the middle and the budding flower on the left both look like grains of <em>rice</em> somewhat, but <em>bound</em> together and on a <em>flower</em>.
