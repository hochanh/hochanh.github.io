1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 10-10-2007(208): An astronaut lands back at the launch<strong> range</strong>, kisses the <em>earth</em> beneath him with his <em>mouth</em>, then heads off to a <em>fiesta</em> to celebrate a safe flight.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama">liosama</a>] 23-7-2008(62): Instead of Heisig&#039;s &quot;Fiesta&quot; I use &quot;Spear&quot;. Why? A spear is just a DROP extra on an Arrow. 域 ,<strong> range</strong> actually means<strong> range</strong> as in limits/boundary/border sort of<strong> range</strong>(In a box it was the old meaning for Country 國 (581). Ok way too much etymology here, but back to story. With your SPEAR standing in a HOLE on the FLOOR with SOIL to its left9as you dug some out), you can see the<strong> RANGE</strong> of the spear in attacking a possible enemy (re Diablo and other RPGs, spear&#039;s have<strong> range</strong>).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jHerbin">jHerbin</a>] 8-4-2010(30): When the <em>land</em> was within <strong>range</strong>, the pirates <em>kissed the deck</em> and had a <em>fiesta</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shadolite">shadolite</a>] 19-2-2008(23): Dora and her party must travel over the<strong> range</strong> of earth, find the mouth of a cave on the ground, and then enter within to get to the fiesta. Remember: Land, Mouth on the ground, Fiesta!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup">mezbup</a>] 27-11-2008(19): Dirty mexicans like to kiss the floor at the fiestas on the<strong> range</strong>.
