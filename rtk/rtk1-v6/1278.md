1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jimsublimeman">jimsublimeman</a>] 4-12-2007(225): The <em>cavern refugees</em> are so poor that they can&#039;t afford thermometers. So, the menfolk expose their <em>crotches</em> inside the cavern, and approximate the temperature in<strong> degrees</strong> from how shrivelled everything looks downstairs...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb">jameserb</a>] 3-5-2008(64): The cave is twenty<strong> degrees</strong> cooler than the outdoors. Twenty male crotches experience shrinkage.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/epsilondelta">epsilondelta</a>] 14-12-2009(62): PRIMITIVE: <em>Cave</em> + <em>twenty</em> = <strong>Finnish sauna</strong> (instead of Heisig&#039;s &quot;caverns&quot;, which I&#039;d confuse with &quot;cave&quot;). STORY: When it gets 95<strong> degrees</strong> Celsius (or 200<strong> degrees</strong> Fahrenheit) in the <em>sauna</em>, you start feeling the heat in your <em>crotch</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 20-12-2005(32): You might want to pick a seat in the <em>cavern</em> a little closer to the cooking fire, though. Otherwise, the second you sit down on the cold rocks, the temperature of your <em>crotch</em> will drop about fifty<strong> degrees</strong>!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 8-2-2008(15): (Continuing story from previous kanji - thanks matticus) One of the commoners has no towel. As soon as he sits down on the cold rocks of the <em>caverns</em>, the temperature of his <em>crotch</em> drops about fifty<strong> degrees</strong>!
