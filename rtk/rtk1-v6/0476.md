2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 16-1-2008(52): Not only is stroke order important, but also be sure to note the <em>direction</em> of a stroke. In both &#039;spoon&#039; and &#039;seven&#039;, the first stroke is the horizontal one - but here it is written right to left in a downward flick, while in &#039;seven&#039; it is a strong line from left to right.
