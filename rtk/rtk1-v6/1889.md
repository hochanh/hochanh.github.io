1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/msukovich">msukovich</a>] 3-6-2008(225): Japanese censorship laws require pornos to use a <em>mosaic</em> screen, so you can&#039;t see what the porno chick is <strong>grasping</strong> with her <em>fingers</em> (but you can assume, neetch).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tristanthorn">tristanthorn</a>] 18-3-2009(139): Your <em>fingers</em><strong> grasp</strong> the <em>Rubic&#039;s cube</em>... if only your brain could too.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 17-5-2007(43): <em>Mosaic</em> primative = <em>rubic&#039;s cube</em>. Here <em>Shrek</em><strong> grasp</strong>s his <em>Rubic&#039;s cube</em> trying to get a<strong> grasp</strong> on how it&#039;s done.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 2-3-2007(25): The <em>Rubik&#039;s Cube</em> keeps slipping out of my <em>finger&#039;s</em><strong> grasp</strong> every time I try to turn it. One of the children must have been playing with it earlier...

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 2-8-2009(22): To me, the &#039;mosaic&#039; primitive looks just like a <em>computer mouse</em>. (<strong>Grasp</strong>ing your <em>fingers</em> around the <em>computer mouse</em>.).
