1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(150): A<strong> pelt</strong> is hooked on a branch. A small tent is made with a<strong> pelt</strong> and a branch planted in the ground. The mnemonic hints at the first stroke (the hanging<strong> pelt</strong>) and the hook at the end of the second stroke. This is chinese radical #107 meaning “skin”.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/myglagata">myglagata</a>] 14-5-2008(54): To be honest, this is one of those cases where I have found it easier to &quot;just remember it&quot; as a radical, as it occurs so frequently: 彼 （かれ him） 波 （なみ wave）and so on.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/howdycowdy">howdycowdy</a>] 18-4-2008(24): Davy Crocket used to hang his coon-skin<strong> PELT</strong> on a <em>branch</em> that had grown out over the edge of a <em>cliff</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow">Harrow</a>] 17-2-2009(16): The head from the tiger<strong> pelt</strong> is hooked over the branch (<a href="../v4/1990.html">tiger</a> (#1990 虎) also has this hook on it), and the tiger&#039;s tail hangs down on the left. This is Hobbes <strong>pretending</strong> to be a<strong> pelt</strong>, which makes the image not so sad.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Howdoken">Howdoken</a>] 13-2-2008(10): The<strong> pelt</strong> Jason travelled so far for was found <em>hanging</em> from the <em>crooked</em> <em>branch</em> of a tree, standing alone on a <em>cliff</em>.
