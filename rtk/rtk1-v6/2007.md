1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 12-4-2007(196): The porn <strong>director</strong> has <em>one</em> big <em>mouth</em>. &quot;Don&#039;t bother putting your clothes on a <em>hanger</em>, just get started.&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 27-7-2008(92): The<strong> director</strong> sticks a <em>clothes hanger</em> in each actor&#039;s <em>mouth</em> and hangs them from the <em>ceiling</em> until he needs them.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shaydwyrm">shaydwyrm</a>] 19-7-2007(69): I think of this one as a pictograph of a guy talking on one of those headsets with a microphone attached - he&#039;s <strong>directing</strong> a movie, so he has to be constantly in touch with everyone!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cheesemaster64">Cheesemaster64</a>] 24-5-2009(30): Every<strong> director</strong> is the <em>same</em>( 同じ ). But this<strong> director</strong>, this one, he&#039;s different.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 1-1-2006(21): This<strong> director</strong> is filming an ad for some washing powder. A bunch of kids are hanging from a clothes line, on <em>clothes hangers</em>. They aren&#039;t quiet and are making a lot of noise. Only one of them, at the center, is facing the camera and needs to deliver a line. The<strong> director</strong> becomes hysterical and using his megaphone yells at them &quot;SHUT UP! I WANT TO SEE ONLY <em>ONE OPEN MOUTH</em> !&quot;.
