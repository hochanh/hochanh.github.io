1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 3-11-2006(265): Don&#039;t give <em>water</em> to a <em>skeleton</em>. When he drinks it, it&#039;ll sluice right through his bones, forcing you to put one of those &quot;Caution -<strong> Slippery</strong> Floor&quot; signs up on the resultant puddle.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ramchip">Ramchip</a>] 10-6-2008(98): <strong>Slippery</strong> surfaces are very dangerous for skeletons, since their bone feet slip easily... a few drops of water, and zweep! A large mess of bones to pick up and reassemble!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb">jameserb</a>] 19-5-2008(23): Caution: Skeletons in these waters indicate someone didn&#039;t abide by the &quot;slippery when wet&quot; sign.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dtcamero">dtcamero</a>] 17-6-2010(15): <em>WET SKELETONS</em> are notoriously<strong> SLIPPERY</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Captain+Kanjipants">Captain+Kanjipants</a>] 27-2-2010(13): Most<strong> slippery</strong> when wet signs show a picture of <em>water</em> to caution you. This one goes a little far by showing a <em>skeleton</em> laying in the middle of a pool of water.
