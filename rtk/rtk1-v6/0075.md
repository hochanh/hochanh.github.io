1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jeremy">Jeremy</a>] 11-7-2006(113): This is a fish hook, that pulls out the<strong> fishguts</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bakamono">bakamono</a>] 20-8-2007(41): You cut a fish in a z shape on the belly to make it easier to open the fish and rip out its <strong>fish guts</strong> silly!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 3-11-2007(35): &quot;Knife goes in, guts come out&quot; (-Bart Simpson&#039;s mantra as he guts fish in &quot;30 Minutes Over Tokyo&quot;). To be more specific: first, cut a 乙 -shape in the belly of the fish, <strong>second</strong>, pull the<strong> fishguts</strong> out. (Note that the most common meaning of this kanji is not &#039;fishguts&#039; as Heisig connotates, but &#039;second&#039;).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cruger">Cruger</a>] 26-7-2008(25): Fishgutz.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/GrimPanda">GrimPanda</a>] 21-9-2010(18): Really this will rarely be seen as<strong> fishguts</strong> as a Kanji, usually it&#039;s 2nd party, or latter, generally always meaning 2nd in some way. It&#039;s easy to remember this as &quot;2nd&quot; since it looks like a 2. Then just remember it&#039;s a fishhook primitive like any other kanji that changes it&#039;s meaning as a primitive.
