1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 14-2-2008(185): <strong>Freight</strong> is the <em>shells</em> (money) paid to <em>change</em> the location of something big. Don&#039;t confuse with the similar 賃 <a href="../v4/1004.html">fare</a> (#1004 賃).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 7-9-2007(97): This is a<strong> freight</strong> train that runs on <em>spare change</em>. Imagine getting on the<strong> freight</strong> train with a bunch of <em>spare change</em>. You put in some <em>change</em> and it starts up...goes for a few minutes, then starts to slow down. You look at the slot..there&#039;s actually a slot for <em>spare change</em> and one for regular <em>shells</em>. Your call, but it seems to prefer <em>spare change</em> over <em>shells</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu">ruisu</a>] 17-11-2007(46): Countries like to <em>change</em> <em>money</em> by trading<strong> freight</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 20-3-2009(36): This is also commonly used to mean currency, which is easier to remember given the kanji I think. When you travel abroad you change your clams into the local currency. Easy breezy.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 13-12-2008(13): You catch the<strong> freight</strong> train, but suddenly realise you did not bring enough <em>money</em>. You turn out your pockets to show the inspector that you have nothing but spare <em>change</em>.
