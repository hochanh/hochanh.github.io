1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 1-3-2007(203): Good <strong>evaluation</strong> should always be <em>words</em> of <em>even</em> fairness.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pm215">pm215</a>] 1-1-2009(118): You get an <strong>evaluation</strong> copy of MS <em>Word</em> because you want to <strong>evaluate</strong> whether it&#039;s worth buying the full version. At the end of the <strong>evaluation</strong> period the CD turns into a <em>lily</em>pad so you can&#039;t use it any more (an innovative new copy-protection trick).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/javiergakusei">javiergakusei</a>] 22-9-2007(34): The first time I delivered a speech in japanese it was a mess! The juries (it was contest)<strong> Evaluate</strong>d me and gave me a bad score because the Words were not said in an Even tone. I guess I was too nervous (true story).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thunderball">Thunderball</a>] 24-9-2007(22): <em>Words</em> have to come out in an <em>even</em> tone during a Japanese speaking test, otherwise your <strong>evalutation</strong> will have bad <strong>comments</strong> written all over it, resulting in <strong>criticism</strong> from your teacher. He your (ひょう) teacher though, so it&#039;s his fault! NOTE: This kanji also means &#039;comment&#039; &amp; &#039;criticism&#039;.
