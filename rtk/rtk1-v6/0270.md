1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nilfisq">nilfisq</a>] 14-8-2007(165): In order to build a<strong> pagoda</strong> in this small Japanese garden everything has to <em>fit</em>: the <em>soil</em> to the left and the <em>flowers</em> in the upper right corner.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xeyes">xeyes</a>] 21-5-2007(48): Pictograph-o-rama. This is a corner of a Japanese garden, with a small mound of <em>soil</em> on the left, and a little concrete<strong> pagoda</strong> in the front with <em>flowers</em> behind it. (To my eye, the <em>fit</em> looks a lot like a little<strong> pagoda</strong> anyway. This may or may not cause confusion for you, though...).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu">nolusu</a>] 13-7-2007(39): The <em>ground</em> next to the<strong> pagoda</strong> could barely <em>fit</em> all the <em>flowers</em> the empress wanted planted.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anthropic">anthropic</a>] 7-7-2008(34): Thankfully I was in a <strong>pagoda</strong> when I, ummm, <em>soil</em>ed myself, the <em>flowers</em> covered up the smell and the mess <em>fit</em> out one of the holes in the side while no one was watching...

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yasser">Yasser</a>] 9-11-2008(23): A<strong> pagoda</strong> is a place of harmony in Japan. This means that even the &quot;soil&quot; where &quot;flowers&quot; are planted must &quot;fit&quot; together (good for remembering the order of writing).
