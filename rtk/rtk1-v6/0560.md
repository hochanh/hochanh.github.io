1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zwarte_kat">zwarte_kat</a>] 15-4-2007(360): A<strong> butterfly</strong> is an insect that appears after spending a generation on a tree as a cocoon.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 13-2-2008(44): Tip: New primitive: Let <em>Tarzan</em> = <em>generation</em> + <em>tree</em> -- because <em>Tarzan</em> lives with several <em>generation</em>s of his family at the top of a <em>tree</em>. (This combination appears five times: <a href="../v4/228.html">leaf</a> (#228 葉),<strong> butterfly</strong>, (FRAME 521), <a href="../v4/2158.html">chatter</a> (#2158 喋), <a href="../v4/2726.html">secret agent</a> (#2726 諜), <a href="../v4/2926.html">label</a> (#2926 牒)). Story: You see <em>Tarzan</em> swinging from tree to tree chasing an <em>insect</em>. Later he shows it to you neatly pinned into his<strong> butterfly</strong> collection.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wasurenaide">wasurenaide</a>] 15-6-2007(36): Butterflies are insects that like to eat just the flowers but leave the leaves behind. (helps me to think of the kanji for leaves, minus the flower bit).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Howdoken">Howdoken</a>] 4-1-2008(17): If an ugly <em>insect</em> can spend many <em>generations</em> in a <em>tree</em>, it will emerge as a beautiful<strong> butterfly</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wilsoncb">wilsoncb</a>] 4-2-2009(12): Imagine a tree which is weighed down, so much that its bending over, perhaps, by GENERATIONS of accumulated cocoons (this also helps place generation over tree). You know which INSECT is responsible: the<strong> butterfly</strong>.
