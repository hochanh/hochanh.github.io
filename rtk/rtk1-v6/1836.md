1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 28-7-2007(139): All <em>stamps</em> in <em>Mr T</em>&#039;s collection <em>box</em> are lied carefully <strong>face-up</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 29-2-2008(128): Mr T with the post package at the post office: &#039;these stamps don&#039;t stick to the box, foo&#039; Postguy:&#039; Try it again but this time with the stamp,<strong> face-up</strong>.&#039;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 12-9-2006(26): <em>Chuck Norris</em> always plays poker with his cards<strong> face-up</strong> because he can&#039;t be beat anyway. Try and cheat and you&#039;ll end up the recipient of a roundhouse kick to the head and will leave the room in a <em>box</em> with a <em>stamp</em> addressed to the local morge.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 12-10-2006(21): A person who is a <em>stamp</em> collector has all of the <em>stamps</em><strong> face-up</strong> in their box.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nuriko">Nuriko</a>] 29-3-2008(16): If you&#039;re using &quot;chikan&quot; for the small box + stamp primitive, here&#039;s a story for you: chikan&#039;s trip in the small box with the stamps all over it is getting boring... good thing he&#039;s laying<strong> face-up</strong> though and has a flashlight with him, because he&#039;s pasted pictures of Mr. T to the roof of the box. That&#039;s his idol who he looks up to in awe, and never grows tired of looking at him (this covers both meanings Heisig mentioned).
