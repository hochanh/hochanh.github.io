2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 18-3-2009(44): A<strong> thong</strong> is no more than a <em>thread</em> used by <em>someone</em> as underwear!

A <strong>ninja</strong> must be able to steal a <strong>thread</strong> from a woman&#039;s<strong> thong</strong> without her noticing.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wisego">wisego</a>] 6-7-2009(17): <em>Spidey</em> and a <em>Ninja</em> fight over a sexy<strong> thong</strong> they found, but then they realize that together ( 一緒 ) they could easily get another... ショ 一緒 いっしょ(together) チヨ 情緒 じょうちょ(heartstrings)….

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/desmidus">desmidus</a>] 31-3-2008(16): Spiderman&#039;s girlfriend throws a<strong> thong</strong> she found in his bed at him. And who&#039;s is this then she asks, and Spiderman replies, uhh... someone&#039;s?
