1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 7-5-2007(84): <strong>Cowardice</strong> is the situation where you get the thought that maybe running away and saving your <em>flesh</em> is a good <em>idea</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 28-12-2008(64): <strong>Cowardice</strong> is when you are not willing to sacrifice your <em>flesh</em> for your <em>ideas</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 2-8-2008(6): A real brave person would never put their <em>flesh</em> before their <em>ideas</em>. That&#039;s why so many people have been killed - for example, in China, where people showed<strong> cowardice</strong> in the face of capitalism. They weren&#039;t willing to put their <em>flesh</em> behind their <em>ideas</em>. Note that <em>flesh</em> is the &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;main&quot; radical in this kanji, which lets you know that this person is emphasizing <em>flesh</em>, and thus, exhibiting <em>cowardice</em>.
