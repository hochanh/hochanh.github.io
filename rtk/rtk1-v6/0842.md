1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(69): Pictograph, see book. * As a primitive, using the image of going through a door, even one that stands alone with the frame and no wall around, helps flesh out the primitive “enter”.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vgambit">vgambit</a>] 26-12-2008(36): Gordon Freeman <strong>enters</strong> the Black Mesa corporation&#039;s headquarters on that fateful day, after starting up a game of Half-Life (this kanji looks exactly like the lambda from the logo when written).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 11-8-2008(11): Something only a Native American could pull off instead of saying &quot;Come in please.&quot;. When used as a primitive, instead of<strong> enter</strong>, I use a <strong>tepee</strong> for this character. See my stories up to <a href="../v4/787.html">sue</a> (#787 訟).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/myglagata">myglagata</a>] 12-5-2008(8): Note that the printed character and the written character appear very differently.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brainrobert">brainrobert</a>] 9-6-2010(5): HAIRU<strong> ENTER</strong> 入る person<strong> enter</strong>s stage left.
