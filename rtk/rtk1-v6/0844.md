1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 4-1-2007(159): When something is <em>entered</em> by a <em>dagger</em>, it ends up being cut in several <strong>parts</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 21-3-2008(147): (This kanji also has the meanings of &quot;understand&quot; and &quot;minute&quot;). It&#039;s important to understand that were you to <em>enter</em> an hour with a <em>dagger</em> and cut it into <strong>parts</strong>, those <strong>parts</strong> would be minutes.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu">Kurisu</a>] 28-5-2008(76): Perhaps one of the most read kanji in Japanese. It means to understand, to<strong> part</strong>, fraction, to break up, rate, minute, etc. To understand something completly one must <em>enter</em> a <em>dagger</em> into it to break it up into its <strong>part</strong>s. Imagine understanding a body by doing an autopsy(<em>enter, dagger</em>) and studying the <strong>parts</strong>. <a href="midori://search?text=分かりますか？">分かりますか？</a> .

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hujis">Hujis</a>] 30-11-2008(22): I cut the cake in to <em>eight</em><strong> part</strong>s by using a <em>dagger</em>. Then I ate one<strong> part</strong> every minute. (I just found eight easier to use than enter.).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattimus">mattimus</a>] 19-4-2010(13): Forget mnemonics for this one. Just look at it, it&#039;s a sword<strong> part</strong>ing the line above it (cutting it into two<strong> part</strong>s). Easy!
