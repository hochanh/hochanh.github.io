1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 14-2-2008(204): Let <em>wood</em>en <em>goods</em> = <em>furniture</em>. Then: Walking along the sea shore you see some washed-up <em>furniture</em> with <em>water</em> (waves) splashing against it. From a distance it looks like <em>flowers</em> are growing out the top, but as you get closer you see it is in fact<strong> seaweed</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura">vosmiura</a>] 30-12-2007(50): Take<strong> seaweed</strong> (<em>water</em> + <em>flower</em>) and hang it to dry in a <em>tree</em> to produce nori <em>goods</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 16-3-2007(30): <strong>Seawood</strong> is the <em>flower</em> of the ocean. When you pile as <em>goods</em> on a <em>pallet</em> they drip <em>water</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 22-6-2006(16): Goods + wood = paper. You know how nori, ie:<strong> seaweed</strong>, comes in sheets for putting in your ramen or for your sushi? Well that&#039;s because it&#039;s water paper!<strong> Seaweed</strong> is also a sea flower of sorts, so it all just works out.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama">MeisterLlama</a>] 28-4-2009(10): Real<strong> seaweed</strong> serves as furniture for all the sea creatures.
