1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 20-3-2007(211): We just <strong>verification</strong> that there are indeed no soldiers in the belly of this trojan <em>horse</em>. We&#039;re just gonna stab it in the belly with this <em>awl</em> to check.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raseru">raseru</a>] 16-6-2008(40): The<strong> verification</strong> proves the horse is real by poking it with an ice pick.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 9-1-2006(20): Here we have a French <em>trojan horse</em> undergoing<strong> verification</strong> by the British police, or immigration, or other authority. The British police are punching into the <em>trojan horse</em> &#039;s sides with an<em>awl</em>, to try and find if it is concealing people. Of course they aren&#039;t going to find much by using an <em>awl</em> for that purpose (the <em>awl</em> having such a short tip), but the sillyness of it should be enough to remember it.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/genbaku">genbaku</a>] 23-1-2008(13): Verify the horse is genuine by poking it with an awl.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 26-11-2008(11): They finally came up with a <strong>verification</strong> system to make sure that giant wooden horses weren&#039;t <em>trojan horses</em>. <em>Frankenstein</em> comes up and slaps the hell out of the side of each wooden horse. If it&#039;s hollow and soldiers are discovered inside, the <strong>verification</strong> process is complete and the <em>trojan horse</em> is destroyed before it&#039;s brought into the city.
