1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 16-4-2007(98): You ever wondered why this appeared as a primitive in so many RTK1 kanji? Well, you should know that once a vulture<strong> grab</strong>s hold of a <em>tree</em>, he can never let go. Even Heisig couldn&#039;t shake him loose.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu">Kurisu</a>] 12-5-2008(30): A common meaning for this kanji is &#039;DICE&#039;. --- Ever wonder what <em>vultures</em> do up in the <em>trees</em>? They play DICE. But of course, being vultures, they are always <strong>grabbing</strong> the dice away from each other.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 2-3-2009(23): The gigantic VULTURE swoops down and<strong> grab</strong>s that huge TREE!! AAAAH!!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kumakuma">kumakuma</a>] 25-11-2008(5): Like a VULTURE, she<strong> grab</strong>ed my WOOD! Boy, you cannot stop her.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 14-7-2009(3): In a particularly lame X-Men comic, <em>Wolverine</em> is in a <em>tree</em>, and Sabretooth is trying to shake him out of it. <em>Wolverine</em><strong> grab</strong>s the tree trunk as tightly as he can so he doesn&#039;t fall out.
