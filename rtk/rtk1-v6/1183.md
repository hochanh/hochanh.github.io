1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu">nolusu</a>] 8-8-2007(404): A<strong> ritual</strong> such as a circumcision: a small piece of flesh from the crotch is left on the altar.

Now they&#039;re nothing but festivals, but back in the day they were<strong> ritual</strong>s. Most Japanese festivals have a circle dance, just imagine all the old people doing the except same dance but in the buff, wrinkly flesh flapping in the wind and all. Remembered. Unfortunately, perhaps forever.
