1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 10-2-2007(154): The shape of a Yen coin.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 28-1-2006(40): A poor old man is almost killing himself trying to lift a huge <em>glass hood</em> with his <em>cane</em> (using it as a lever), to get to just <em>one</em> yen coin. Note : the kanji refers to a circular, round object, but also to the Japanese currency (pronounced &quot;en&quot;).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew">Matthew</a>] 27-5-2007(27): A pictograph of a bank teller&#039;s window. The<strong> circle</strong>s are the coins which are passed back and forth for deposits and withdrawls.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 30-9-2008(15): Sometimes I wear my <em>top hat</em> under my <em>hood</em> and it makes my head look like a<strong> circle</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 24-2-2008(14): You may wonder why this character is pronounced &#039;en&#039; yet is said &#039;yen&#039; in the west, well this is because when it was first romanized the obsolete ゑ character was used and as such became yen in the west.
