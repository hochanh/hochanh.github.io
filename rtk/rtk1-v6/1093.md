4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama">MeisterLlama</a>] 29-4-2009(20): Correct keyword: <strong>ridge</strong> ( 畔 -&gt;waterside). ( 畝 is used in 畝間 , meaning<strong> furrow</strong>, but that&#039;s because the interval between ridges is a<strong> furrow</strong>). Words: 畝 (ridge/rib), 畝織り (ridged fabric). Story: A <em>rice field</em> is actually a secret burial ground for <em>mummies</em>. Each <strong>ridge</strong> is actually a sarcophagus. The <em>mummies</em> are buried under the <strong>ridges</strong>, and each <em>mummy</em> has a <em>top hat</em> which takes up the remaining length of the <strong>ridge</strong>, filled with his riches.
