1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/szreter">szreter</a>] 17-2-2008(264): When the world&#039;s most <em>eminent</em> magician died, everyone&#039;s <em>state of mind</em> became that of<strong> lament</strong>ation. He was buried with his famous sun-flower wand in his hand.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura">vosmiura</a>] 1-6-2007(66): <em>Data</em><strong> lament</strong>s that he could never see his <em>eminent</em> father, his creator, ever again. He paints a picture of his father, that looks like a sunflower in the shape of a magic wand.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ambassadog">ambassadog</a>] 11-12-2008(42): Closely related to grief, mourning and regret, it was difficult for me to isolate this kanji. A<strong> lament</strong> is a song or poem that deals with loss or regret. This brings to mind the works of the world&#039;s most <em>eminent</em> artists, their brilliance and powerful works owed to their <em>emotional states of mind</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vicnet">vicnet</a>] 26-7-2009(22): <strong>Lament</strong> is the <em>state of mind</em> most <em>eminent</em> people live in, because so many expectations lay on their shoulders.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall">pmbeddall</a>] 30-10-2007(17): Instead of using eminent - use its components - <em>divining rod</em> and <em>sunflower</em>. Think of the current state of the environment symbolized by the sunflower and use the divining rod to see the possible future - pollution, global warming, overpopulation - we have a lot to<strong> lament</strong>.
