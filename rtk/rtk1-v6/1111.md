1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 18-3-2007(247): The <em>schoolhouse</em> is the <em>backbone</em> of a foundation that will allow you to find a good<strong> occupation</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 13-11-2006(87): During the German<strong> occupation</strong>, this Nazi officer&#039;s<strong> occupation</strong> was to manage <em>schools</em> that were requisitioned for training the children of the Aryan race to stand proud with an erect <em>spine</em> (mnemonic : &quot;the<strong> occupation</strong>&#039;s <em>spine schools</em>&quot;). Kanji meanings : to manage, to conduct (business), and also &quot;barracks; camp; encapment&quot;. This story should help avoid confusion with <a href="../v4/824.html">post</a> (#824 職) and <a href="../v4/1083.html">employ</a> (#1083 雇). The military<strong> occupation</strong> theme hints to the secondary meaning, e.g. 営倉 &quot;detention barracks&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/walexander5">walexander5</a>] 14-7-2008(56): Stay in <em>school</em> so you can get an<strong> occupation</strong> that doesnt require breaking your <em>backbone</em> all day.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 10-12-2007(23): I get this confused with <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1792">business/profession</a> (#1792 業). An<strong> occupation</strong> is something you can get after you leave the <em>schoolhouse</em> with a <em>backbone</em> of knowledge, but to get a profession you need to move on to higher education.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 19-5-2008(20): ATCHUNG!!! This keyword stands for <strong>Military<strong> occupation</strong></strong>, and not profession, as it could be (incorrectly) assumed from the primitives. Meanings: <strong>Management</strong>, <strong>Military Camp</strong>.
