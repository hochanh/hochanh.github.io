In such case the dictionary definition can be helpful : &quot;Middle English, single, indivisible&quot;. Here we have <em>Mr. T.</em> who is so <em>hardened</em> (all the body workout he&#039;s had) that he became <strong>in-dividual</strong>, that is, in-divisible. &quot;I pity da foo who can be divided into smaller units.&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 5-9-2007(86): <em>Mr. T</em> insists that people be<strong> individual</strong>. He appears on television, saying, &quot;Being an<strong> individual</strong> is <em>hard</em>! But you gotta do it! <em>Harden</em> yourself, and be<strong> individual</strong>!&quot;.
