1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 1-5-2008(196): I was retreating from the battlefield. In the chaos, my friend threw his dogtags at me to give to his family. I managed to<strong> catch</strong> them with my fingers as the chopper was lifting off.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 20-8-2007(84): <em>Dog tag</em>: This is a wild animal track device. It has an <em>arrowhead</em> and <em>screwdriver</em>-shaped radio beacon. It&#039;s evidently fired in animals to track their movements. When animal has a <em>dog tag</em>, it&#039;s easy to <strong>catch</strong> it: just take a <em>dog tag</em> in your <em>fingers</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 16-9-2009(52): &quot;Dog tag&quot; appears later as a kanji on its own: <a href="../v4/2097.html">offspring</a> (#2097 甫) Offspring are pretty slippery when they come out of the womb; be sure to<strong> catch</strong> the baby with your fingers so it doesn&#039;t slide and fall on the floor!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 9-4-2007(23): In some countries when they<strong> catch</strong> a thief, they cut his fingers and put a sturdy RFID dog tag on him. (I made this all up of course).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Joyo1945">Joyo1945</a>] 11-6-2009(16): Its easy to<strong> catch</strong> a dog if it has <em>dog tags</em> because you can just use your <em>fingers</em> to take it by the collar.
