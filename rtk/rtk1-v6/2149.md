1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joxn_costello">joxn_costello</a>] 8-2-2009(166): This is a story about the end of the universe. The universe is turning into a featureless <em>void</em>. There&#039;s nothing we can do about it except for throw a <em>fiesta</em> and<strong> frolic</strong> a little bit before it&#039;s all over.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nerdjnerdbird">nerdjnerdbird</a>] 6-10-2007(47): Sigfreid and Roy&#039;s contract having been <em>void</em>ed, the tiger is free to<strong> frolic</strong> about at the <em>fiesta</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Holmes">Holmes</a>] 30-12-2007(31): The fiesta was void. you go on a<strong> frolic</strong> of your own.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lasercorn">lasercorn</a>] 13-7-2008(24): This <em>fietsa</em> has been <em>voided</em>. You&#039;ll have find somewhere else to<strong> frolic</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pm215">pm215</a>] 16-12-2008(23): &#039;frolic&#039; to me implies something essentially empty and meaningless. It might look like a <em>fiesta</em> on the surface but somehow there&#039;s a <em>void</em> at its centre. (and there&#039;s even an &#039;o&#039; in the middle of the word...).
