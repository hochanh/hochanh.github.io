1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 15-8-2006(181): I imagine thomeone who can not pronounth the &quot;s&quot; and<strong> speaketh</strong> like thith becauth they have a <em>cane</em> in their <em>mouth</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 14-2-2008(90): I had persistent trouble confusing this one with 曰 <a href="../v4/578.html">sayeth</a> (#578 曰). The way I keep it sorted out is that this one is used in &quot;moshi moshi&quot; when answering the phone, similar to the way an American would say &quot;hello, this is X <strong>speaking</strong>.&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mistamark">mistamark</a>] 26-10-2008(61): The <em>cross</em> in the <em>mouth</em> of the <em>Monkey</em> ensured it<strong> speaketh</strong> no evil.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35">ruuku35</a>] 26-5-2007(21): A MONKEY can&#039;t<strong> SPEAKETH</strong> of anything if he has a WALKING STICK driven through his TOUNGE WAGGING IN HIS MOUTH.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/furrykef">furrykef</a>] 2-7-2008(14): Distinguished from <a href="../v4/578.html">sayeth</a> (#578 曰) in that we&#039;re surprised that the <em>monkey</em> can speak at all: &quot;The monkey<strong> speaketh</strong>!&quot;.
