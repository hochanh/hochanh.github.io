1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zareon">Zareon</a>] 3-4-2007(203): It&#039;s a tremendous match between the two chess-players. They are clearly eachother&#039;s equal.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 4-8-2007(49): These two <em>bushel baskets</em> are <strong>tremendously</strong> huge. But not only they are huge, they are also perfectly <em>equal</em> in size.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 11-3-2007(44): Losing both your <em>rooks</em> is <strong>tremendous</strong>. It&#039;s almost <em>equal</em> to having your queen&#039;s <em>legs</em> chopped from under her.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/baylin">baylin</a>] 8-7-2009(22): This kanji is<strong> tremendously</strong> difficult to remember because it is not <em>equal</em> to the other bushel baskets in this lesson. Their <em>bushel baskets</em> all have animal legs.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal">captal</a>] 15-6-2008(14): Equal I remember as the counter for small animals. Remember Battle Chess? I just picture a tremendous <strong>rook</strong> from Battle Chess wandering around stomping on <strong>little animals</strong>. Those guys were sweet.
