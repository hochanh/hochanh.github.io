1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Avispa">Avispa</a>] 31-8-2007(236): It&#039;s<strong> usual</strong> to take your <em>towel</em> with your when you go to the <em>outhouse</em> at the onsen (hot springs bath in Japan) so everybody doesn&#039;t see your stuff.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Asgard">Asgard</a>] 2-9-2006(91): In the <em>outhouse</em> toilet you&#039;d<strong> usual</strong>ly hope to find toilet paper to wipe your ass. If it&#039;s already gone, which is<strong> usual</strong>ly the case, simply use the <em>towel</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Proxx">Proxx</a>] 7-2-2008(71): It&#039;s<strong> usual</strong> to carry along your own <em>towel</em> when you are in Japan, because at the <em>outhouse</em>s (public toilets) there are no frickin&#039; <em>towel</em>s (or something else) to dry your hands. (<strong>usual</strong>ly gaijins use there trousers... ).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matt_jenkins">matt_jenkins</a>] 24-3-2008(26): Tnx Adhmm: a man walks into his pub and says &#039;the<strong> USUAL</strong>&#039;, whereupon the bartender hands him a dirty towel from the floor of the outhouse and he sits there chewing it.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 16-6-2009(11): Showering at your friend&#039;s house, you accidently use their good towel. &quot;Don&#039;t use my <em>esteemed towel</em>!&quot; he cries. &quot;That&#039;s for special guests! Use the<strong> usual</strong> <em>towel</em>!&quot; At this point, you&#039;re offended at not being worthy of his &quot;<em>esteemed towel</em>&quot; and storm out of his house, naked and wet.
