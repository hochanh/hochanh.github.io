1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 14-2-2008(232): Tip: <em>goods</em> + <em>wood/tree</em> : This combination of primitives appears four times in Heisig, so it&#039;s worthwhile giving it a name. I suggest &quot;<em>furniture</em>&quot; (a common type of <em>wooden goods</em>). REF: <a href="../v4/215.html">parch</a> (#215 燥) , <em>maneuver</em> (FRAME 671), <a href="../v4/1369.html">winding</a> (#1369 繰), <a href="../v4/2035.html">seaweed</a> (#2035 藻). Story: Using just a <em>finger</em> you are trying to<strong> maneuver</strong> your <em>furniture</em> round your room.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jaresty">jaresty</a>] 3-10-2007(147): Luke skywalker points his fingers and uses the force to<strong> maneuver</strong> the goods through the tree branches and up over the tree.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dat5h">dat5h</a>] 27-5-2009(34): The rare kanji 喿 means &quot;chirping birds.&quot; Therefore, why not use it since it occurs 4 times in Heisig? (note that it looks like a bunch of mouths up in a tree) Story: Think of <em>Thing</em> from the Adam&#039;s family (just a <em>hand</em> walking around) crawling around in a tree. He carefully<strong> maneuver</strong>&#039;s (this way and that) in order to isolate and stalk his pray, the <em>chirping birds</em>. They are quite a nuisance and he<strong> maneuver</strong>s up close and snatches one in his <em>fingers</em>, thus silencing its <em>chirping</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu">ruisu</a>] 28-11-2007(31): The apple/orange/coconut picker <strong>maneuvers</strong> his way around the <em>tree</em>, grabbing the <em>goods</em> with his <em>fingers</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kuraujiokun">kuraujiokun</a>] 22-7-2009(19): Being good <strong>maneuvering</strong> using your <em>fingers</em> in <strong>Mario Kart</strong> isn&#039;t enough! You still have to avoid all the <em>goods</em> the other players throw at you and hitting the <em>trees</em>.
