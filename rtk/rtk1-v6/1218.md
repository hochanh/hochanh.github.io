1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 14-9-2007(244): [Based on fuaburisu&#039;s] A man puts some <em>rice</em> on a <em>fishhook</em> as bait, but catches a fish so strong, he needs to take out his <em>axe</em> and <strong>sever</strong> the line lest he be dragged into the depths.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/marydj">marydj</a>] 25-10-2007(117): When you get the ax at work, use your<strong> severance</strong> pay to buy fishhooks and rice. At least that way you can eat sushi.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 17-5-2006(59): The <em>axe man</em> is fishing at a nearby river, using a <em>rice-ball on a hook</em> as bait. He catches some real big fish, which is pulling so hard on the line that <em>axe man</em> has to <strong>sever</strong> the line or let go of his pricey fishing rod. And at the same time there is the idea of<strong> severance</strong> in <em>axe man</em> having to let go of his big catch.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 28-3-2012(53): Your manager brings you into his office and offers you three<strong> severance</strong> packages. You can take the <em>hook</em> (become a fisherman), take the <em>rice</em> (become a farmer), or take the <em>axe</em> (become a lumberjack). Picture the items laid out on his desk like the shopkeepers in Zelda.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 6-10-2008(23): After he got <em>hooked</em> on <em>rice</em> wine the Japanese salaryman got the <em>axe</em> at work. Now all he has to live on is serverance pay.
