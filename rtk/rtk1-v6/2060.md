1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 20-2-2008(170): Don&#039;t play <em>dice</em> with birds. When you&#039;re not looking, they&#039;ll<strong> flip</strong> the <em>dice</em> with their <em>feathers</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 29-4-2007(77): When the birds out the back are playing <em>dice</em>, they<strong> flip</strong> their <em>feathers</em> (not their finger) at their opponents.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 28-3-2008(38): According to my books, this<strong> flip</strong> is related to<strong> flip</strong>ping food in a frying pan or something like that. To <em>flip</em> an omelette, you need first some eggs. But you said it aloud, and when you go to the <em>field</em>, you find it empty except for some <em>animal tracks</em> and some missing <em>feathers</em>. The chickens have escaped!! <em>(music from &quot;Chicken Run&quot;)</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/torabi">torabi</a>] 1-6-2008(36): It&#039;s your <em>turn</em> to<strong> flip</strong> the chicken <em>wings</em> on grill.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 28-8-2007(30): These are crooked <em>dice</em>, modified using the latest robotic technology. To <strong>flip</strong> right in flight, they momentarily stick out tiny <em>feathered</em> wings to perform few deft flaps.
