1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew">Matthew</a>] 23-6-2006(148): The word ‘sutra’ literally means a rope or thread that holds things together. Here we see that it is a <em>spool</em> that is holding the <em>threads</em> together.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 18-2-2008(105): Suggestion: Replace &quot;spool&quot; with &quot;toilet paper/roll&quot;. Reasons: (1) <em>Toilet paper/roll</em> usually comes on a <em>spool</em>. (2) <em>Toilet paper</em> is used to clean the <em>soil</em> off your <em>crotch</em>. Story: <em>Spiderman</em> (= thread) has a roll of <em>toilet paper</em> with the words of a<strong> sutra</strong> printed on each sheet (picture <em>Spiderman</em> saying the<strong> sutra</strong> as he tears sheets off the <em>toilet roll</em>). Spool also appears in <a href="../v4/715.html">stalk</a> (#715 茎), <a href="../v4/716.html">suspicious</a> (#716 怪), <a href="../v4/717.html">lightly</a> (#717 軽), <a href="../v4/882.html">diameter</a> (#882 径).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joesan">joesan</a>] 10-11-2007(96): <em>Spiderman</em> is intriqued by some of the positions of the karma<strong> sutra</strong>, but reluctant to take part in an<strong> sutra</strong> orgy as he&#039;d have to reveal his <em>soiled underwear</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 18-1-2008(19): A<strong> sutra</strong> reads: time <strong>flows</strong> as a <em>thread</em> constantly <strong>flowing</strong> out of a <em>spool</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 8-1-2010(18): <em>Spider-Man&#039;s</em> kama<strong> sutra</strong> technique is so crazy that he always needs a whole roll of <em>toilet paper</em> to clean up afterward. Mary Jane is always soaked in a sticky white substance, and it isn&#039;t Spidey&#039;s webs.
