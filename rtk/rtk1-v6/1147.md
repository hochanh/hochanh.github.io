5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 13-5-2008(17): The<strong> bureau</strong> (FBI) released a <em>phrase</em>book designed for survival in any country. I looked at my copy and asked a girl if I could buy her a drink, but the book was wrong.. I asked if I could <em>pee</em> on her instead. Luckily it all worked out.. (Note: I use &quot;pee&quot; for the &quot;flag&quot; primitive).
