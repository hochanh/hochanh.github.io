1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 2-9-2006(270): &quot;Dude! What happened to your arm! It&#039;s all bound up!&quot; &quot;Yeah man, it&#039;s a bummer... with my arm like this I can only lift one<strong> monme</strong>!&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 3-12-2007(57): &quot;Dude! What happened to your arm! It&#039;s all bound up!&quot; &quot;Yeah man, it&#039;s a bummer... with my arm like this I can only lift one<strong> monme</strong>!&quot; &quot;You&#039;ll never be able to use your dagger now!&quot; (adapted from ergerg).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ikeda_kat2007">Ikeda_kat2007</a>] 31-12-2007(52): In Jamaica: Hey <strong>mon, may</strong> I have some (3.75 grams to be exact) uh dat leaf? I need it fo medical reasons. Look at my bound up arm!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sindhikara">sindhikara</a>] 2-12-2008(37): Either Heisig or the person who put this on the list is an asshole. Most JP people have never seen it. Heisig admits is useless. I hope his arms get bound up by the police for carrying a<strong> monme</strong> of crack.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 24-9-2007(34): Very difficult to picture, however, a<strong> MONME</strong> is very light, only 3.75 grams. So, imagine your BOUND UP sore ARM. Now imagine the weight of the cloth that BOUND UP your ARM. Yep, you guessed it. It weighs one<strong> MONME</strong>.
