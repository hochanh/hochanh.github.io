4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 13-4-2010(24): In Japan, you basically have to <em>wag your tongue</em> after each <em>spoonful</em> you eat in order to talk about how<strong> delicious</strong> the food is. To learn this just watch Japanese television, on basically any channel, for 15 minutes. Girls say &#039;oishii&#039;, but guys usually use &#039;umai,&#039; which is written with this very kanji: 旨い (うまい).
