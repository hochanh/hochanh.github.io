1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rakushun">Rakushun</a>] 27-12-2007(150): The <em>golden calf</em> is sent to the <em>gates of Hell</em> for it&#039;s<strong> connection</strong> to false idols.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/szreter">szreter</a>] 8-7-2008(75): There&#039;s a weird<strong> connection</strong> between worshipping the <em>golden calf</em> and visiting the <em>gates of Hell</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/noname">noname</a>] 28-3-2008(30): See my story for 2016. The<strong> CONNECTION</strong> between the GATES OF HELL and MASTODONS is that the GATES were made out of MASTODON horns (b/c they so big and old).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/spoonsman">spoonsman</a>] 9-4-2009(23): At the airport, the <em>woolly mammoth</em> was too big. When he tried to go through his flight&#039;s <em>gate</em> he got stuck and missed his <strong>connecting</strong> flight.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattimus">mattimus</a>] 26-11-2009(17): <em>Bill Gates</em> and the <em>woolly mammoth</em> gazed longingly at one another. Bill squeezed her hand gently; &quot;Do you feel it? The<strong> connection</strong>? It&#039;s... electric.&quot; The mammoth blushed, twinges of anticipation and fear coursing through her heart. Could they really start over? She didn&#039;t want to get hurt again, but the<strong> connection</strong> was still so deep; so real. She looked Bill in the eyes: &quot;Don&#039;t you break my heart again Bill.&quot; &quot;I love you, baby. Let&#039;s go back to my place. I&#039;m going to get Pleistocene on your fat ass.&quot;.
