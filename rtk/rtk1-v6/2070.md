1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 7-10-2007(152): The Geisha with<strong> long</strong> <em>hair</em> uses an ornate lacquered <em>hairpin</em> to bundle it all up.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 22-6-2008(74): The top of this one reminds me of the staple primitive. So here&#039;s my story: The girl&#039;s hair was so<strong> long</strong> that she had to use <em>staples</em> instead of <em>hairpins</em>. It worked, but stapling her hair to her head was kinda painful.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 5-1-2006(25): As a primitive I use the image of (very)<strong> long</strong> hair. Let this kanji represent a &quot;Swiss Hairpin&quot; (similar to a Swiss army knife) : the top part being a pictogram for <em>half a comb</em>, and the lower part being the <em>hairpin</em>. Just make sure not to confuse with the kanji for &quot;comb&quot;. Think of this one as a &quot;<em>half a comb</em>&quot; that can be pulled from the &quot;Swiss Hairpin&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/noname">noname</a>] 12-3-2008(14): HAIRPIN: This is rather similar to that for SCARF. Both a HAIRPIN and a SCARF can be used for holding back<strong> long</strong> hair. STORY: The first 4 strokes could be a pictograph of hair blowing in the wind. It&#039;s too<strong> LONG</strong> and getting in your way, so you pin it back.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 30-11-2009(8): The<strong> long</strong> haired Geisha <em>staples</em> on an ornate <em>hairpin</em> so it won&#039;t slip. (Thanks to Zactacular for the idea.).
