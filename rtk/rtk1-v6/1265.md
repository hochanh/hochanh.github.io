1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 7-5-2007(141): To tenderize <em>meat</em> in an emergency wilderness situation, just<strong> utilize</strong> your <em>walking stick</em>!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 20-12-2007(115): I&#039;ll confuse this with <a href="../v4/990.html">use</a> (#990 使), so build a distinction right from the start. For me, &quot;utilize&quot; has an artificial, business-speak connotation; you only<strong> utilize</strong> &quot;utilize&quot; when you&#039;re trying to puff up what you&#039;re saying and sound important. So: &quot;BioTools Inc introduces the FG2000 screwdriver, <strong>utilizing</strong> the our latest <em>Flesh</em>Grip(tm) technology!&quot; I&#039;m seeing this as a picture of a stubby screwdriver with a handle made of <em>flesh</em>, a short <em>shaft</em>, and prongs to hold a screw in place until you drive it.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nmkohi">nmkohi</a>] 4-4-2006(74): When your flesh is weak you must<strong> utilize</strong> a walking stick.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax">Zarxrax</a>] 18-5-2008(35): We have to<strong> utilize</strong> different tools for different jobs. If some object in your kitchen needs to be be screwed, you would<strong> utilize</strong> a <strong>screwdriver</strong>. If your woman needs to be screwed, you would<strong> utilize</strong> your <em>meat stick</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 10-10-2008(27): NASA<strong> utilize</strong>s a giant laser to cut the moon in half. Very shortly, the Earth will have two <em>companion</em> moons.
