1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 6-10-2007(216): <strong>Younger brothers</strong> are always more prone to mischief. Mine, you can almost see the little <em>horns</em> on him and the <em>dollar signs</em> on his eyes when he comes up with a money-making scheme.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taijuando">taijuando</a>] 29-1-2007(67): The<strong> younger brother</strong> was a <em>horny</em> <em>dollar</em> -chasing bastard.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 6-3-2007(35): This is a picture of my stupid<strong> younger brother</strong>&#039;s tattoo. I can&#039;t believe he thinks a red <em>dollar sign</em> with devil&#039;s <em>horns</em> is cool.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 12-10-2008(21): My <em>horny</em><strong> younger brother</strong> is always pinching <em>dollars</em> from me for porn.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew">Matthew</a>] 5-7-2006(18): <em>Condolences</em> for the freakish<strong> younger brother</strong> who was born with <em>horns</em> and a <em>tail</em> (the long diagonal stroke at the bottom).
