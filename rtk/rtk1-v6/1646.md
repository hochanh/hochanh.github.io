1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 15-6-2007(124): The A/C wasn&#039;t making the house <em>cold</em> because the filters had been <strong>blocked up</strong> with <em>dirt</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 19-3-2010(18): It was so <a href="../v4/1526.html">cold</a> (#1526 寒), the pipes <strong>blocked up</strong> with ice. After <em>removing the ice</em>, we insulated them with <em>soil</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 31-7-2009(6): If you cared enough to<strong> block up</strong> that hole around the edge of the window that lets that <em>cold</em> draft in, it wouldn&#039;t feel so <em>icy</em> in here. It doesn&#039;t matter what you<strong> block up</strong> the hole with, even <em>soil</em> will do! Just do it soon, it&#039;s freezing in here.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lankydan">lankydan</a>] 13-9-2007(6): <strong>Block up</strong> <em>cold</em> house with <em>dirt</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stupiddog">stupiddog</a>] 22-9-2011(3): Occurs in heart attack ( 心筋梗塞 ). To prevent it: Get out of the <em>house</em> (do sports!) regulary, eat good things (<em>celery</em> comes to mind) and do not snack between meals (no fast food <em>dirt</em>!) (thanks to dukelexon for the inspiration!).
