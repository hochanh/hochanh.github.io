1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 13-10-2006(199): You first wash you clothes with <em>water</em> and wring them until they are just<strong> damp</strong> before hanging them in a <em>row</em> under the <em>sun</em> to dry. If you don&#039;t wring them<strong> damp</strong> first they will take days to dry!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 20-6-2007(53): When your things are<strong> damp</strong>, you line them up in a row under the sun.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 9-12-2006(28): An image: a shirt hangs on the oars of an old <em>rowboat</em>. Though it is slowly being dried by the <em>sun</em> high above, the occasional <em>drops of water</em> from it indicate that it is still<strong> damp</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 16-9-2009(11): I&#039;ll bet most of us have had this experience at a water park... You are gazing at the <em>water</em> hungrily while standing under the hot <em>sun</em>, waiting in a long <em>row</em> to get on the water slide. By the time it&#039;s your turn, you&#039;ve been under the sun so long that you&#039;re not even all that wet anymore - just a little bit<strong> damp</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 14-7-2007(9): The <em>row</em> of penguins find themselves in the front row, right under the <em>sun</em>. It&#039;s very hot, so they spray themselves with cool <em>water</em>. This of course makes the entire theatre very<strong> damp</strong>!
