1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Deborah">Deborah</a>] 27-10-2007(127): An <em>OLD TASKMASTER</em> is no<strong> happenstance</strong> (coincidence). The older you get the more rigid in your ways.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 23-7-2007(51): Need to disambiguate from <a href="../v4/443.html">enemy</a> (#443 敵) as it&#039;s easy to mix up <strong>antique</strong> and <strong>old</strong> here. Let&#039;s think of an accidental president -- he is an <strong>old</strong> <strong>taskmaster</strong> who has managed to win the election by<strong> happenstance</strong> .

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/binky">binky</a>] 29-7-2009(30): Only an old taskmaster uses a stupid word like &quot;happenstance&quot; instead of the many less pretentious synonyms for luck or chance.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dogray77">dogray77</a>] 22-1-2008(30): It&#039;s not just a<strong> happenstance</strong> that the taskmaster looks old before his time.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meredithcat">meredithcat</a>] 4-4-2010(18): I recently ran into my <em>old taskmaster</em> purely by<strong> happenstance</strong>.
