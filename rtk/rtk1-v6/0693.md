2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 2-9-2007(157): <em>Cows</em> are truly <em>righteous</em> animals. They<strong> SACRIFICE</strong> their milk so that we can have some. And if they don&#039;t have any left, they give a <em>sheep</em> a <em>hand fiesta</em> (good lord this is going too far) and give us that instead. What <em>righteous</em> <em>cows</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 26-5-2008(102): There are two kanji that need to be kept separate: this one and <a href="../v4/1559.html">animal sacrifice</a> (#1559 牲). Think of it this way: here there is a <em>cow</em> and a <em>righteous</em> person (presumably a Hindu). One must be <strong>SACRIFICE</strong>d, so the righteous Hindu takes the place of the holy cow. But by the time frame 1559 rolls around, the Hindu is no longer alive to protect the cow, resulting in the <em>cow&#039;s life</em> ending in an <strong>animal<strong> sacrifice</strong></strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rivvie">Rivvie</a>] 18-2-2008(65): Vegetarians<strong> sacrifice</strong> eating steak (<em>cow</em>) because they believe it is a <em>righteous</em> thing to do.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MYRRIA">MYRRIA</a>] 28-9-2008(16): In the old testament times, <em>COWS</em> were<strong> SACRIFICE</strong> for <em>RIGHTEOUSNESS</em>.
