1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 28-2-2007(175): This whole kanji is a picture of <strong>calm</strong>ness. The <em>wheat</em> has been harvested and even the <em>vultures</em> sit<strong> calm</strong>ly watching the humans <em>sweep</em> and clean-up after the harvest is over. <em>Hearts</em> are peaceful and<strong> calm</strong> at this time of the year. Even the days are<strong> calm</strong> without storm.
