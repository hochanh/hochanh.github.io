1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura">vosmiura</a>] 30-10-2007(238): Horror scene: Hanging from the <em>ceiling</em>, a <em>plough</em> and <em>fishhook</em> <em>dripping</em> with blood down onto the <strong>tile</strong>d bathroom floor.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/penot">penot</a>] 28-11-2008(176): [<strong>true stroke order</strong>] First draw <em><strong>T</strong></em> for<strong> Tile</strong>, which then becomes <em><strong>I</strong></em>. Then draw an <em>&#039;<strong>L</strong>&#039; fish hook</em> with a <em>dash</em> in the middle to make a mediocre &#039;<strong>e</strong>&#039; that few can see.//ガ wa3 와 (wa).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Biene">Biene</a>] 5-5-2008(96): Note: This <strong>tile</strong> means roof-<strong>tile</strong> (e.g. 屋根瓦 ), not the ones you put on the floor. Hanging from the <em>ceiling</em> of an old shed are a rusty <em>plow</em> and some tangled up <em>fishhooks</em>. Since the <strong>tiles</strong> on the roof are old and broken some rainwater is leeking through and you can see <em>drops</em> glistening between the <em>plow</em> and the <em>fishhooks</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 24-5-2006(18): As said in errata, this is ceiling+plow+fishhook+a drop of (and stroke order goes accordingly). A plow is fixed on the ceiling and a fishhook is hanging on the plow, drawing a drop of blood from it (if animals can talk, why can&#039;t plows bleed? :-).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 4-7-2009(11): Simple ~ spell out the word. First draw a T, then add a line on the bottom to change it to an I. Draw an L (the fishhook shape) then go back and add a dash beside the I, like adding the center dash of an E.
