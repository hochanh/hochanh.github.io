1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 30-10-2006(311): The <em>owl</em> looks for its prey in the <em>rice field</em>. It sees so many potential <strong>animal</strong>s to eat but since it only has <em>one mouth</em>, it decides that the tasty looking <em>chihuahua</em> will be its meal for tonight. (adapted from Copycatken,1-9-2006).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 13-10-2007(77): I have a strange story for this one but it works. I imagine a <em>owl</em> getting into a <em>rice field</em> which serves as a boxing ring. His opponent is a little <em>chihuahua</em>. The fight starts, the <em>owl</em> takes <em>one</em> punch to the <em>mouth</em> and is out cold. In the <em>chihuahua&#039;s</em> corner is that coach from Rocky saying &quot;Your an<strong> ANIMAL</strong>!!&quot;. A vivid image of this story works pretty well for me.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Copycatken">Copycatken</a>] 1-9-2006(32): The <em>owl</em> looks for its prey in the <em>rice field</em>. It sees so many potential<strong> animal</strong>s to eat but since it only has <em>one mouth</em>, it decides that the <em>dog</em> will be its meal for tonight.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/plumage">plumage</a>] 21-7-2009(22): An OWL in the FIELD looks for an<strong> animal</strong> for dinner, and with ONE MOUTHful consumes a CHIHUAHUA. (simplified from others).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eri401">eri401</a>] 2-7-2011(16): This kanji is used for sort of monstrous beasts. Imagine a mythical<strong> animal</strong> with an <em>owl</em>&#039;s head and a <em>dog</em>&#039;s body. It is so large that it can devour an entire <em>rice field</em> with <em>one mouth</em>. 怪獣 【かいじゅう】 (n) monster; 獣 【けもの(P); けだもの(P); じゅう】 (n) beast; brute.
