1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wzafran">wzafran</a>] 16-7-2007(157): Imagine a newborn baby, fresh out of the womb, being entirely <em>wrapped</em> by the long piece of <em>flesh</em>, called a <strong>placenta</strong>, that once fed him.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(81): <strong>Placenta</strong> is <em>flesh/part of the body</em> <em>wrapped</em> around the foetus.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Phil2Musashi">Phil2Musashi</a>] 2-4-2009(32): <strong>Placenta</strong> is the flesh that wrapped around us when we were in the womb.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 8-11-2010(17): 胞子 , 共産党細胞 , 細胞核 , 同胞 ,<a href="../v4/531.html">placenta</a> (#531 胞)ホウ( 包 ) ... Parts: 月 , 包 ... Note: Not<strong> Placenta</strong>; that&#039;s 胎盤 <a href="../v4/748.html">womb</a> (#748 胎). 胞 is any body sac, of any living thing, including cells ( 細胞 ). ... Story: A <em>Part of the body</em> that completely <em>wraps</em> something up: a cell, a <strong>placenta</strong>, a spore. Include the umbilical cord as part of the<strong> placenta</strong> <em>wrapped around the fetus like a snake</em> After the Fetus is born he swings the snake around like a lasso. YeeeHa!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hujis">Hujis</a>] 28-2-2009(11): The<strong> placenta</strong> is the part of the body which feeds the baby. However this unlucky baby didnt make it because the<strong> placenta</strong> wrapped around its neck and choked it to death. Not a nice story, but a memorable one. (And I know it&#039;s the umbilical cord that feeds the baby, but that doesnt affect the story).
