1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 22-8-2006(170): A<strong> collar</strong> is the part of your <em>cloak</em> that, if tightened too tight, will <em>prohibit</em> breathing.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 16-9-2007(115): <strong>Collar</strong>s are <em>prohibited</em> from wizarding <em>cloaks</em>. Blood purists say they&#039;re too muggle.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wasurenaide">wasurenaide</a>] 24-11-2007(67): Dress code: all <em>cloaks</em> without<strong> collar</strong>s are <em>prohibited</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 15-8-2008(40): In some future anti-Catholic dystopia, a <em>prohibition</em> against <strong>collars</strong> has been enacted, so Catholic priests often conceal them (or <em>cloak</em> them) underneath their <em>cloaks</em>. Imagine a cloaked Catholic priest walking down the street when he sees a police officer approaching him, and the priest nervously tightens his <em>cloak</em> to ensure his<strong> collar</strong> isn&#039;t seen.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nebusoku">nebusoku</a>] 18-8-2009(23): Popping the<strong> collar</strong> on any <em>cloak</em> is strictly <em>prohibited</em> because doing so will make you look like an enormous douchebag. <em>Fun fact</em>: the phrase &quot;pop [one&#039;s]<strong> collar</strong>&quot; is <a href="midori://search?text=「襟を立てる」">「襟を立てる」</a> in Japanese.
