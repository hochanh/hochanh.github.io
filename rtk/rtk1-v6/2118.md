1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 4-9-2008(174): For the <em>condor</em> primitive: A <strong>condor</strong> is like a <em>vulture</em>, but <em>twice</em> as big and it lives near <em>mountains</em> (a suitable place for such a majestic bird). For<strong> swing</strong>: I&#039;m sitting on a<strong> swing</strong> when a <em>condor</em> comes by and picks up the whole<strong> swing</strong> set with its big <em>finger</em>-like claws and now I&#039;m<strong> swing</strong>ing in mid-air. Weeeeeeeee!!!!!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 15-6-2007(141): I keep<strong> swing</strong>ing gleefuly on the talons of the <em>soaring condor</em> until he slices off my <em>fingers</em> and sends me plummeting.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 8-2-2008(27): I don&#039;t recommend using king as a primitive for condor, the stroke order is wrong. Vulture Dry Mountain or even Vulture Two Mountains should work better.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 31-3-2008(22): This kanji is for <strong>tremors</strong> and <strong>shakes</strong>. It perfectly illustrates the good ol&#039; joke of <strong>shaking</strong> a beverage <em>tin can</em> in your <em>fingers</em>. And then laugh when another person opens the can with his/her <em>nails</em> (claws) and gets totally soaked! (<em>Tin can</em> loses the left stroke because it has no pull tab).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/noname">noname</a>] 18-3-2008(13): I am sure you have heard this on the trains in Japan: <a href="midori://search?text=「これから揺れますので、ご注意ください」">「これから揺れますので、ご注意ください」</a> So imagine that the train does<strong> SWING</strong> and SHAKE. This gives ちかん&#039;s the opportunity to pretend like they fell and grab a feel on a nearby girl like a CONDOR would with their claws.
