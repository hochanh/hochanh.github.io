1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shizuru">Shizuru</a>] 2-8-2007(305): This is my favorite story. Simply associate the sad moment of an OLD person, standing near the WATER of the<strong> lake</strong> and looking at the MOON reflected in the<strong> lake</strong>. The created primitives themselves are put so beautifully, that you will not forget this kanji.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DBJ07">DBJ07</a>] 17-2-2007(94): Water reflects the old moon in the<strong> lake</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/I_pity_the_fool">I_pity_the_fool</a>] 21-5-2008(51): Water + old + flesh. Imagine a group of senior citizens skinnydipping in a nearby<strong> lake</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 20-2-2008(38): Tip: Heisig later combines <em>old</em> and <em>moon</em> into 胡 <a href="../v4/2470.html">uncivilized</a> (#2470 胡). Story: Drinking <em>water</em> straight from the<strong> lake</strong> is rather <em>uncivilized</em>. (OR: <em>Uncivilized</em> communities get their <em>water</em> straight from the<strong> lake</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/krungthep">krungthep</a>] 26-3-2008(23): Some<strong> lake</strong>s are used by criminals to dump <em>old</em> <em>body parts</em> in the <em>water</em>.
