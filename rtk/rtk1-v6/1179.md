1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snallygaster">snallygaster</a>] 26-9-2007(224): Similar to radical tyro&#039;s story. If you live in Japan, your main exposure to this kanji is probably &quot;no smoking&quot; signs. So I imagine the government enacting a<strong> prohibition</strong> of tobacco, and burning whole groves of tobacco plants on an altar (the altar of public health, or self-righteousness, if you will).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thunderball">Thunderball</a>] 7-8-2007(37): Hidden in a <em>grove</em> was a church with a secret <em>altar</em> that was stocked full of <strong>prohibited</strong> alcohol during the American<strong> prohibition</strong> period of 1920-1933. A local registered himself as a mininster of this <em>altar</em> so he could stock <strong>prohibited</strong> alcohol &quot;for sacremental purposes&quot; and share it with his <em>kin</em> (きん).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/genbaku">genbaku</a>] 13-1-2008(25): Placing trees on this alter is prohibited.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Antunes">Antunes</a>] 21-12-2006(21): When Chirstianity was prohibited and the christians were being chased in Japan they had to hide their altars under the groves.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 29-5-2009(12): During<strong> prohibition</strong>, people drank hidden in <em>groves</em> so that they wouldn&#039;t be <em>shown</em> drinking in public.
