3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 21-1-2006(39): I use a play on words here to help with the similar keywords such as &quot;strand&quot;, and &quot;coast&quot;. The<strong> Beach</strong> Boys just had a concert down at the<strong> beach</strong>, and they&#039;re all wet after the performance. It&#039;s not <em>dry</em> enough down at the<strong> beach</strong> so they climb the nearest <em>cliff</em>. Still, it&#039;s not <em>dry</em> enough there so they climb the nearest <em>mountain</em>. Finally, the air seems <em>dry</em> and they take a rest while their clothes <em>dry</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Mesqueeb">Mesqueeb</a>] 13-4-2009(16): The fastest way to reach the<strong> beach</strong> starting from our mountain cabin is to go down the MOUNTAIN until the CLIFF and slide down the CLOTHESLINE directly onto the<strong> beach</strong>!
