1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 4-1-2007(165): This character refers to feudal<strong> clan</strong>s that were abolished in 1871 (Meiji 4) in favor of prefectures ( 廃藩置県 ), and thus were predecessors of the modern prefectures. As we know from 落 , flowers and water drops each have their own way of falling. This character says that<strong> clan</strong>s&#039; location was decided in the way flowers, water drops and dice fall: at random.
