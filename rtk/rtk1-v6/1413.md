1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 28-8-2007(249): A black<strong> hole</strong> is a &quot;House of Infinity&quot;. Infinity is of course represented by a sideways &quot;8&quot;, but here we have a Japanese &quot;8&quot; instead.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zz_alex_zz">zz_alex_zz</a>] 19-2-2008(105): Billiards anyone? <em>House</em> rules here state that the first person to pot the <em>eight</em> ball into the <strong>hole</strong> wins the game.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/montecristo73">montecristo73</a>] 20-7-2009(20): What good is it to buy a house with 8<strong> hole</strong>s in the ceiling? (The kanji for 8 also looks like water flowing from the ceiling.).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 15-8-2006(15): I think of people playing on a mini golf course. One player is frustrated because the ball got stuck into a <em>house</em> (a small building decoration), and ends up doing a &quot;hole-in-<em>eight</em>&quot; instead of a<strong> hole</strong>-in-one.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jackhuddleston">jackhuddleston</a>] 19-5-2008(11): I came home one day to find that termites had <em>eight</em> my entire <em>house</em>... nothing but a<strong> hole</strong> left.
