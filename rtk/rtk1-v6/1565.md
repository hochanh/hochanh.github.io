1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(65): <strong>Indigo</strong> <em>flowers</em> have to be <em>overseen</em> because they are often picked for their beauty.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 5-1-2010(45): Traditionally, 青 <a href="../v4/1534.html">blue</a> (#1534 青) could be used to describe blue OR green. However, two kanji that describe the hues specifically are 藍 and 緑 . This kanji is the &quot;blue&quot; counterpart of <a href="../v4/1371.html">green</a> (#1371 緑). Story: The <em>overseer</em>, master of the slaves, wore a cloak dyed with<strong> indigo</strong>, and <em>flowers</em> in his hair.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 8-4-2007(5): The princess who likes to <em>oversee</em> the making of her dishes, often wears<strong> indigo</strong> coloured clothes.<strong> Indigo</strong> is made from <em>flowers</em>.
