I want you to go check the<strong> status</strong> of each tree.&quot; &quot;Errr, Each tree sir?&quot; replies the ranger looking out over the vast forest. &quot;That&#039;s Right, I want the<strong> status</strong> of each tree!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 11-12-2007(73): I find I need a more concrete image for this. EACH TREE has it&#039;s own<strong> STATUS</strong>. For example, the Christmas Tree is holy, the Willow is of high class while the lowly Bonsai is of low class.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/takoman">takoman</a>] 11-1-2008(26): (カク, コウ) In Japan, where land is so precious, <em>each tree</em> you have helps elevate your<strong> status</strong> in society. Unless you are Kumi KOUda and can actually afford to buy lots of trees, the only way you will get them is if you KAKU them.
