1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 26-1-2008(308): <em>Spider-Man</em> is <em>hooked</em> on <em>rice</em>--it&#039;s all he<strong> inherit</strong>ed from his Uncle Ben. (thanks Nukemarine).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 5-4-2007(69): A poor chinese fisherman could expect to <strong>inherit</strong>: the <em>thread</em> for his pole, a <em>hook</em> for catching something to eat, and some <em>rice</em> to live off of. (not concentrating on stroke order, sorry if that throws anyone off). (Adapted from bigloui,12-4-2006).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 20-10-2007(40): The<strong> INHERIT</strong>ANCE given to SPIDERMAN was only RICE, because it came from his &quot;Uncle Ben&quot;, ha ha ha, get the HOOK? &quot;Uncle Ben&quot; RICE? To be fair, I couldn&#039;t work hook into that tale very well.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jaresty">jaresty</a>] 14-11-2007(23): Uncle Ben <em>was</em> the employee that got the axe in <a href="../v4/1136.html">severance</a> (#1136 断), so naturally the <em>fishing hook</em> and <em>rice ball</em> is all that <em>spidey</em> will<strong> inherit</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bigloui">bigloui</a>] 12-4-2006(11): A poor chinese farmer could expect to<strong> inherit</strong>: the <em>thread</em> of life, a <em>hook</em> for catching something to eat, and some <em>rice</em> to live off of. (not concentrating on stroke order, sorry if that throws anyone off).
