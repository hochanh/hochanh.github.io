1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 28-11-2008(87): Do you remember that song where they <em>say</em> &quot;<strong>Who</strong> let the <em>turkeys</em> out!? Gobble.. gobble.. gobble&quot;?

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 5-2-2007(40): [who; someone; somebody] You&#039;re alone when, suddenly, you think you hear someone <em>speak</em>ing. &quot;<strong>Who</strong>&#039;s there?&quot;, you <em>say</em>, but there is no answer. Then you find out it was only a <em>turkey</em> gobbling. You feel relieved (and ashamed to tell this story). (Based on raulir).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wally">Wally</a>] 10-4-2009(23): <strong>Who</strong> talks turkey? (I&#039;m surprised this common American phrase &#039;talk turkey&#039; hasn&#039;t made it in here. It is North American centric, however -- and how the <em>heck</em> is this <em>not</em> in RTK 1? I mean, primary school kids have to know this kanji.).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 29-4-2006(16): &quot;<strong>Who</strong>&#039;s there?&quot; he says, but it was only a turkey.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hknamida">hknamida</a>] 21-1-2008(11): <em>Socrates</em> spins around, startled. &quot;<strong>Who</strong>&#039;s there?&quot; It turns out that it is only a <em>turkey</em>, and the philosopher is safe... for now. （だれ）.
