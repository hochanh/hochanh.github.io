4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sarek05">sarek05</a>] 14-10-2008(36): I assasinated the <em>taskmasker</em>. When the arrowhead hit his <em>brain</em>, bits and pieces<strong> spread</strong> out in all <em>directions</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/karmatheif">karmatheif</a>] 19-1-2010(13): This is the （しき）used in ふろしき 風呂敷 , which is when the Japanese bundle something in a large cloth, then gather the ends togther and tie it at the top to carry it around. Story: Imagine an eccentric <em>taskmaster</em> who feels the need to carry a gigantic ふろしき everywhere for his picnics, so he can<strong> spread</strong> it in all <em>directions</em>, cover a whole <em>field</em> and pins the corners to the ground with stone <em>arrowheads</em>.
