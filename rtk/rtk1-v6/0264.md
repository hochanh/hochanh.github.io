5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Melamelachan">Melamelachan</a>] 3-8-2007(16): In 1525, the city of Salzburg was occupied. Legend has it that there was nothing left to eat, except for one <em>cow</em>. To trick the occupying forces, people would paint the cow, and send a human (with <em>human legs</em>) and the <em>cow</em> out for a walk, clearly visible to the enemies. Then, they would use some <em>water</em> to <strong>wash</strong> the <em>cow</em> and paint it with a different colour and so on. Seeing there were still plenty of <em>cows</em> left, the occupiers finally gave up. The people of Salzburg are still called <em>cow</em>-<strong>wash</strong>ers.
