1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 25-10-2006(366): The <em>computer</em> won&#039;t stop beeping, which is making the <em>chihauhua</em> bark, and it&#039;s driving this guy insane. The only solution he can come up with is to throw them both on the <em>fire</em> and finally enjoy the<strong> silence</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wakela">Wakela</a>] 23-3-2007(56): Your neighbor is so sick of you playing Led Zeppelin that he takes your copy of the song Black Dog and burns it. Finally,<strong> silence</strong> in the neighborhood.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 28-11-2007(45): A scene of calm SILENC: You&#039;re typing away on your COMPUTER, while your pet DOG lies beside, a nice FIRE warms you both. No noise to disturb the<strong> SILENCE</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kalamies">kalamies</a>] 30-7-2006(34): <strong>Silence</strong> is a paramount for any <em>black</em> ninja <em>dog</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 29-3-2009(27): HINT: this is NOT black and dog. It is computer, dog and fire. So my risque but memorable story is: sitting at the naked at the <em>computer</em> watching <em>doggystyle</em> porn with a <em>fire</em> to keep me warm. It suddenly gets louder and I have to hit the mute, or<strong> silence</strong> button so as not to disturb the neighbours... Apologies for the rudeness, but was having trouble remembering and this made it stick.
