1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/guidedog">guidedog</a>] 14-7-2007(171): If you mis-guess the cheese you&#039;ll<strong> grate</strong> your fingers on the cheese-grater (happens to me all the time).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 8-3-2008(72): Ouch! <em>Guess</em> how many <em>fingers</em> I just<strong> grate</strong>d in the<strong> grate</strong>r? (Edit: OR: Ouch! <em>Guess</em> what I just<strong> grate</strong>d in the<strong> grate</strong>r? -- my <em>finger</em>!).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 9-1-2006(52): When you<strong> grate</strong> something you have to <em>guess</em> where your <em>fingers</em> are so you don&#039;t hurt yourself.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/desmidus">desmidus</a>] 16-2-2008(50): It was a cruel form of torture. He would<strong> grate</strong> cheese and by the smell make me guess what sort of cheese it was. If my guess was wrong, he would<strong> grate</strong> one of my fingers. Which is how I know how pretty much every cheese smells now, although I don&#039;t have many working fingers left.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 26-2-2009(35): The meaning of this kanji is more like &quot;rub, scour, scratch, or scrape.&quot; Story: Frustratedly trying to solve a math equation on the classroom chalkboard, the student made a sound that would really<strong> GRATE</strong> on everyone&#039;s nerves. She would<strong> GRATE</strong> her FINGERnails on the chalkboard as she GUESSED at the next step in solving the equation.
