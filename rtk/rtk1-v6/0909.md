1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew">Matthew</a>] 17-6-2006(282): <strong>Iron</strong> is a<em> metal</em> that gradually becomes <em>lost</em> due to oxidation and rust.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 20-10-2008(105): Compare with <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/270">pig-iron</a> (#270 銑). In moving from <strong>pig-iron</strong> to<strong> iron</strong>, some of the <em>metal&#039;s</em> maleability is <em>LOST</em>. (The only difference between the two kanji is that<strong> IRON</strong> has knee-less, unbending legs, while PIG-IRON (270) has very supple, bendable legs.).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thermal">thermal</a>] 10-6-2008(52): <strong>Iron</strong> man will never lose.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tcjeff">tcjeff</a>] 13-6-2008(37): I accidentally <em>dropped</em> a bucket of molten<strong> iron</strong> on my husband one day at the factory. He died instantly, but I didn&#039;t know what to do with his remains. Somehow an art collector heard about my plight and offered me three million in <em>gold</em> for my &quot;masterpiece&quot;. He called it<strong> Iron</strong> Man. So all because of a bucket of molten<strong> iron</strong>, I gained some <em>gold</em> and <em>lost</em> a husband.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjisensei">kanjisensei</a>] 25-10-2009(15): <strong>Iron</strong> weights a lot. It&#039;s a metal that&#039;s easy to drop.
