1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 16-6-2007(221): Enemy: &quot;Any final<strong> request</strong>s?&quot; // MacGyver: &quot;Just an <em>arrowhead</em> and some <em>grains of rice</em>.&quot; (MacGyver then throws the <em>grains of rice</em> at the enemy and uses the <em>arrowhead</em> to cut his hands free from the rope.).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 22-8-2007(134): <em>Robin Hood</em> holds his rich victim at <em>arrowpoint</em> and kindly <strong>request</strong>s that he hands over his <em>grains of rice</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nagisa">nagisa</a>] 27-11-2007(52): A beggar asks for you if you can spare a few grains of rice, after you refuse you find him pointing an arrowhead at your throat. &quot;That wasn&#039;t a<strong> request</strong>.&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 1-7-2008(39): For reasons I&#039;ll leave up to you, a monk is being put to death. &quot;Any last<strong> REQUEST</strong>S?&quot; they asked him, as they began to squirt <em>drops</em> of poison from a <em>needle</em> into the <em>water</em> of his intravenous line. Yet he said nothing, only concentrating on 求道 , <strong>seeking</strong> the path to enlightenment. (PLEASE note that the 部首 for this character is &quot;shitamizu&quot; - NOT rice, but <em>water</em>. Also, the keyword &quot;seek&quot; would be much more appropriate, and it is not used elsewhere in RTK. shrug).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 12-6-2010(18): I don&#039;t<strong> request</strong> much, just <em>one</em> <em>drop</em> of those <em>rice grains</em>.
