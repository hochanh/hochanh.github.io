1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/greenapple">greenapple</a>] 27-8-2006(570): We printed a japanese flag on his white towel by stabbing him with a saber while he was wearing it.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomtosh">tomtosh</a>] 21-12-2007(73): The image that keeps coming to me is of the giant mechanical<strong> printing</strong> presses. The <em>cloth</em>-based material is coming off the roll like a flag and then, after<strong> printing</strong>, gets cut into sheets by <em>saber</em>-like cutting tools.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 1-2-2008(22): You&#039;re short of paper, so you try<strong> printing</strong> on a towel. Your unhappy printer shows you a red flag but when you show it your sword it becomes very obedient and starts<strong> printing</strong>. Awful quality, but the printer did what it could...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb">jameserb</a>] 30-10-2008(13): Modern laser printers can print on flags and towels with saber-like precision.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 14-5-2008(10): Before the invention of the<strong> printing</strong> press, there were many failures, such as the peeing press. Yep, having people <em>pee</em> onto <em>towels</em> that had letters cut into them with <em>sabers</em> just didn&#039;t work very well.. (note: I use &quot;pee&quot; for the &quot;flag&quot; primitive.
