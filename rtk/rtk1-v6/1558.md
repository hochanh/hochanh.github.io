1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 26-1-2010(183): (re: Raichu) An undercover<strong> alliance</strong> between Japan (the <em>sun</em> on its flag) and Turkey (the <em>moon</em> on its flag) detected by a surveillance satellite <em>dish</em>. <a href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100126a3.html">http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100126a3.html</a>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 13-5-2006(86): A new<strong> alliance</strong> is proclaimed at the end of a meal between officials. As a symbol of their<strong> alliance</strong> they clean up together one <em>dish</em>, and present it to the photographers. The clean dish under the flash lights appears very <em>bright</em>, and it&#039;s pretty much all you can see on the photo that appears on the next morning&#039;s newspapers, with the title &quot;New<strong> alliance</strong>, one <em>bright dish</em>!&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Crowfoot">Crowfoot</a>] 2-6-2008(52): The <em>bright dishes</em> in the cupboard form an<strong> alliance</strong> against the others.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 18-1-2010(44): In medieval Japan (during Sengoku Jidai) there was an interesting ritual to form an<strong> alliance</strong> between different samurai clans. The warlord, who wanted to propose to form an<strong> alliance</strong> to another warlord, would send him a big ceremonial <em>dish</em> with the <em>sun</em> drawn in the center. If the proposal were accepted, the second warlord would draw an image of the <em>moon</em> next to the <em>sun</em> on the same <em>dish</em>, and then return the <em>dish</em> to the first warlord. (not true story, but helped me to create vivid image).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 1-3-2007(20): The <strong>alliance</strong> has built <em>bright</em> satellite <em>dish</em>es to defeat the rebels.
