1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 15-10-2006(243): A<strong> gutter</strong> <em>funnels</em> <em>water</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 23-4-2007(65): A <strong>gutter</strong> takes the <em>water</em> that falls as rain and <em>funnels</em> it off to where it can be dealt with appropriately.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 25-7-2008(27): <em>Water</em> + <em>funnel</em> ==<strong> gutter</strong>. But really, if you need help with this one, how did you make it this far? :).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 29-12-2007(14): Instead of a normal<strong> gutter</strong>, the city is cutting costs by just putting a huge <em>celery funnel</em> on the side of the road every few hundred yards. While this is actually a bit more efficient than standard<strong> gutter</strong>s and quite cheap, it&#039;sa bit dangerous (as there&#039;s a rather nasty juicing mechanism attached to the bottom of each one). Imagine telling some kids to stay out of the<strong> gutter</strong> on a rainy day, and one of them not heeding you (kids love splashing in them!) and falling to her doom.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jeebus101">jeebus101</a>] 23-2-2013(3): [using &#039;diet&#039; as right hand primitive] Alcoholics will land in the<strong> gutter</strong> if they keep up their <em>liquid diet</em> consisting of only alcohol.
