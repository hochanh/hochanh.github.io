5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow">Harrow</a>] 9-12-2008(8): What we are calling wheat really refers to a<strong> rice plant</strong>, known to Wolverine from olden times (Wolverine is a lot older than he looks -- he was born in the 1880s). Imagine Wolverine in ancient times (mukashi mukashi) planting rice by poking a little hole with his claws and then settling the plant into the mud.
