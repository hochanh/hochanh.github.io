2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 1-11-2007(97): Imagine kids <em>all over</em> the top of a<strong> mulberry</strong> <em>tree</em>, sitting astride limbs so that their weight is on their <em>crotches</em>. (Mulberry trees have big sprawling limbs that run horizontally or at shallow angles making them easy to climb and sit in. I have an old<strong> mulberry</strong> in my yard, and my kids are in it constantly).
