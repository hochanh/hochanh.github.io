1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 12-4-2007(162): The speed <strong>limit</strong> at <em>The Pinnacle</em> is posted on <em>silver</em> signs.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pazustep">pazustep</a>] 10-8-2008(64): At <em>The Pinnacle</em>, they<strong> limit</strong> how much <em>silver</em> you can have. Too much silver will lead to wrongfulness.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 9-4-2008(50): Not just anyone can gain membership into The Pinnacle, it<strong> limit</strong>s its membership to those with the appropriate amount of silver, both to be used as cash and weaponry in their war against the werewolves. (Mnemonic: Pinnacle<strong> limit</strong>s membership to those with enough silver.).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nuriko">Nuriko</a>] 16-3-2008(18): I&#039;ll elaborate on dingomick&#039;s story to highlight the importance of &quot;silver&quot; in this story so as not to forget. The speed<strong> limit</strong> at The Pinnacle is posted on silver signs... why do you think they are silver? If you remember the top story from <a href="../v4/1459.html">silver</a> (#1459 銀), you know that silver is the metal that reflects the most light and therefore draws a lot of attention to it. These people up in the Pinnacle really want you knowin&#039; them<strong> limit</strong>s.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christoph">Christoph</a>] 14-12-2006(15): I don&#039;t think that my <em>limit</em> is <strong>silver</strong>! I know I can reach the <strong>pinnacle</strong>! gold!!
