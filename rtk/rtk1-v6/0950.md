5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 8-1-2006(27): A <em>heart</em> which was full of<strong> benevolence</strong>, but so small that it could pass through the <em>eye of a needle</em>, was displayed atop a huge Corinthian <em>column</em> (maybe the relic of some Saint). The <em>column</em> which acted as a stand, reminded viewers not to be fooled by the <em>heart</em>&#039;s <em>needle-eye</em> size.
