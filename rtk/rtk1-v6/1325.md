1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 6-3-2007(167): Re CharleyGarrett: This liquid looks like ordinary <em>water</em>, but it will instantly<strong> seethe</strong> when it comes in contact with counterfeit <em>dollar bills</em>. The inventor must be rich (and probably has dollar signs in his eyes).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 12-3-2007(115): When his daughter used a lot of <em>water</em> for her shower, the father could practically see the <em>dollar signs</em>, so he was <strong>seething</strong> with anger.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 3-3-2009(52): This kanji is more closely related to water and emotions boiling. Story: When his daughter used a lot of WATER for her shower, the unemployed father could practically see the DOLLAR SIGNS going down the drain. He began SEETHing with anger... (Thanks smithsonian).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 11-5-2008(29): Hint: This <em>dollar sign</em> is clearly one of those iced out dollar pendants. <a href="http://newworldtreasures.100megs2.com/Test/HHCP221.jpg">http://newworldtreasures.100megs2.com/Test/HHCP221.jpg</a> And just imagine <strong>seething</strong> after someone gets water all over your brand new <em>dollar bling pendant</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ivoSF">ivoSF</a>] 21-1-2008(24): I<strong> seethe</strong> (and not only from the heat)when i found out how many dollars one water bottle costs in this desert!
