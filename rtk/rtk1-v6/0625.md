1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thunderball">Thunderball</a>] 27-9-2007(241): When you are admitted into a<strong> group</strong> like the Yakuza, you&#039;re well and truly done (だん) for. You must stick to the<strong> group</strong> like <em>glue</em>, and you will be <em>pent-in</em> for life, never being able to leave.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/calittle">calittle</a>] 23-9-2007(54): A <em>pent-in</em><strong> group</strong> will naturally be more cohesive, or &quot;<em>glued</em> together.&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rizzo">rizzo</a>] 21-10-2005(43): Living in Japan, this image is too true for comfort. Every<strong> group</strong> I&#039;ve ever encoutered sticks together like <em>glue</em>, but it seems thats not enough so they create little barriers to keep outsiders out and insiders in, once someone finds their<strong> group</strong> they are pretty much <em>pent in</em> for life. (that felt good).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Henduluin">Henduluin</a>] 15-1-2008(25): For the Haruhism people: SOS-dan!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 9-9-2007(24): Picture a bunch of<strong> group</strong>ies on a tour bus with some big rock band. The band members are getting tired of these<strong> group</strong>ies, so the band leaves the tour bus, superglues the door and the windows shut, and leave them all pent up in the bus.
