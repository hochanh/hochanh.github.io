1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fiminor">fiminor</a>] 11-4-2006(162): My rice-seedlings have become sentient and will go on a mission. I can only apologise for the next 6 frames. In the distance, there is a <em>pinnacle</em>, which the newly-awakened <em>rice-seedlings</em> who are still stuck in the <em>ground</em> can see. Could it be the Promised<strong> Land</strong>?

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 23-7-2006(90): When sailors see<strong> land</strong> in the distance, they first see the <em>pinnacles</em> of the new<strong> land</strong>, but when they come close enough they&#039;ll be able to make out the <em>rice seedlings</em>, and finally the <em>ground</em>!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 23-7-2009(70): (圥 is the rare kanji for a mushroom. Sticking out of the <em>ground</em> like little knubby <em>legs</em>, it&#039;s pretty easy to remember.) Story ~ The<strong> land</strong> around <em>The Pinnacle</em> has <em>mushrooms</em> covering the <em>ground</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nuriko">Nuriko</a>] 19-3-2008(46): Primitive: Soil covered human legs is the result of planting rice seedlings into rice paddies all day. Poor rice farmers!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nagisa">nagisa</a>] 4-2-2008(32): The Pinnacle&#039;s<strong> land</strong> is so valuable that they cannot afford to let a single rice seedling be planted in the soil.
