1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ramchip">Ramchip</a>] 22-1-2007(138): In basketball however, tall children<strong> receive</strong> all the attention.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 30-11-2007(87): <em>Tall children</em><strong> receive</strong> all the attention. They also make great<strong> receive</strong>rs in football... this kanji also means &#039;catch&#039; (therefore a football<strong> receive</strong>r is a great image).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dragonslayer131">Dragonslayer131</a>] 19-11-2009(31): Kinda weird but I remember the weird ones best: A giant MOUTH wearing a TOPHAT<strong> RECEIVE</strong>S its next victim to munch on. This time its a small CHILD whimpering under the figure on the floor, scared of what is to come.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Chaze">Chaze</a>] 11-5-2010(21): A word of warning: With Heisig&#039;s story I keep associating this with &quot;attention&quot;! I use something closer tied to the word<strong> receive</strong>: Imagine a bunch of kids finding an old radio. It&#039;s antenna is broken, so the <em>tallest</em> <em>kid</em> has to hold it up, and becomes the designated <strong>receiver</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cefreddffo">cefreddffo</a>] 15-10-2009(13): Usually in yaoi couples the short guy is the one who &quot;receives&quot;. But here we see how the <strong>tall boy</strong> is <em>receiving</em> and he <em>enjoys it</em> ( 享楽する ）. RTK2:　キョウ 享楽主義 きょうらくしゅぎ(hedonism).
