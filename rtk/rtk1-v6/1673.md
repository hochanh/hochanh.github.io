1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 10-4-2007(181): [proportion; comparatively; divide; cut; separate; split] Hey, don&#039;t take this out of <strong>proportion</strong>! I did you just a little <em>harm</em>, no need to come over here with a <em>saber</em>...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 15-10-2007(136): As shown on this pie-chart, the<strong> proportion</strong> of people <em>harmed</em> by <em>sabres</em> is relatively a small slice compared to those <em>harmed</em> by guns.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/QuackingShoe">QuackingShoe</a>] 10-9-2008(73): In Japanese anime and video games, the heroes often have <em>sabers</em> that seem way out of<strong> proportion</strong> to their weilders, especially with how scrawny these pointy-haired kids tend to be. I&#039;m not sure if the<strong> proportion</strong>s of those <em>sabers</em> will cause more <em>harm</em> to their enemies or their weilders... Or, I&#039;m surprised they don&#039;t <em>harm</em> themselves with the<strong> proportion</strong>s of their <em>sabres</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 7-12-2008(24): The <em>harm</em> caused by a <em>saber</em> is not always in<strong> proportion</strong> to its size.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup">mezbup</a>] 25-6-2009(17): The harm is<strong> proportion</strong>al to the size of the saber.
