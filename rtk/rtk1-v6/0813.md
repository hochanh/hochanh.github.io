1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 11-2-2007(258): This kanji shows up in a lot of words related to the legal process. Try this image: using a very outdated judicial<strong> method</strong>, the people of Salem dunked accused witches in the <em>water</em> until they were all <em>gone</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 19-5-2007(102): There already was a <a href="../v4/418.html">system</a> (#418 制) for butchering cows, a <a href="../v4/421.html">technique</a> (#421 芸) for turning smoke into flowers - why can&#039;t there be a <em>method</em> of about the same relevance for making <em>water</em> <em>gone</em>? Evaporation anyone?

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 26-10-2006(63): Following from the last frame; when rubbing isn&#039;t good enough, WATER is the best<strong> METHOD</strong> for making sure the SOIL on your ELBOW is GONE.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 21-3-2008(43): If all the water is gone, we must develop new<strong> method</strong>s to survive. (Imagine Earth devoid of water, the opposite of the movie Waterworld).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TaylorSan">TaylorSan</a>] 31-1-2009(22): The Heisig<strong> Method</strong> will Water down your kanji problems, until at some point, they are gone.
