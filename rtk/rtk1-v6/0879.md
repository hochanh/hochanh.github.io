1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 3-11-2005(284): I imagine an<strong> interment</strong> as a funeral. At this funeral it&#039;s an open casket, and the dead body (death) is holding flowers with both of its hands.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/calittle">calittle</a>] 2-10-2007(74): During the<strong> interment</strong> ceremony, the grandchildren placed <em>flowers</em> over the <em>dead</em> body while the widow sat praying with <em>two hands</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 9-10-2010(36): During<strong> interment</strong>, flowers are placed above <em>death</em>, while <em>two hands</em> from the netherworld are pulling from below.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/humpolec">humpolec</a>] 11-11-2008(20): We see <em>Death</em> himself standing at a funeral. This time he&#039;s not holding his scythe, but he has <em>flowers</em> in both hands.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vertigo959">vertigo959</a>] 6-10-2008(13): I used to confuse 亡 and 死 in this kanji, so I use the image of 死神 (shinigami, or death god) to help remember the right element.--- At this<strong> interment</strong> funeral, underneath the <em>flowers</em> on top of the grave, the <em>death god</em> ( 死神 ）, is descending towards the underworld, lowering the coffin with <em>both hands</em>. ソウ <a href="midori://search?text=葬式。葬る">葬式。葬る</a> .
