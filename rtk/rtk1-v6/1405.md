1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wingedge">wingedge</a>] 22-12-2007(207): &quot;Sunglasses-missing-one-lens&quot; is obviously the <em>monocle</em>. The proper, high-class way to<strong> descend</strong> <em>The Pinnacle</em> is wearing a <em>monocle</em> with your <em>walking legs</em> splayed to a full gentlemanly stride.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 30-5-2007(33): After a cool, hip businessman angered the executives at <em>The Pinnacle</em>, they beat him up, popping out a lens from his <em>sunglasses</em>, and tossed out the window, head first, <em>walking legs</em> second. One executive later commented, &quot;It was like he was<strong> descend</strong>ing into Hell from Heaven!&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 2-1-2007(27): To<strong> descend</strong> from <em>The Pinnacle</em> you must <em>walk</em> down the stairs with your sunglasses-missing-one-lense on.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 27-8-2008(18): Used in 降りる 【おりる】（to alight or get off - e.g. from a bus). So here we have a tour bus arriving at the <em>acropolis</em>: Everyone <strong>descends</strong> from the bus, stretches their <em>walking legs</em> and puts on their <em>monocles</em>. (EDIT: fixed up primitives).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mikedough2">mikedough2</a>] 24-1-2008(16): A Yakuza member<strong> descend</strong>ing down from the <em>pinnacle</em> with limping <em>walking legs</em> and a lens from his <em>sunglasses</em> missing. He tried to break into the resort but the security threw him out.
