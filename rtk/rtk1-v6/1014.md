1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 14-5-2007(182): <em>Bamboo</em> is the best material from which to make a <em>brush</em> if you want it to be a<strong> writing brush</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 8-7-2008(57): Traditionally, the ふで, or<strong> writing brush</strong>, was made with a <em>bamboo</em> handle and the hair of an animal (usually horse, rabbit, or wolf). Before the advent of paper (which the Chinese invented), writing was also done on segments of bamboo.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 3-1-2010(11): When the <em>panda</em> held the magical<strong> writing brush</strong>, he was able to draw every Heisig kanji without having even studied the book. Picture yourself studying for months and the panda picks up the<strong> writing brush</strong> and does better than you.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matt_jenkins">matt_jenkins</a>] 7-4-2008(7): For <em>bamboo</em>, I visualise <em>panda</em>. The first writing <em>brushes</em> were of an enormous size, because there was no ink as yet and scribes had to write by poking <em>pandas</em> in the backside and writing with panda manure. (<em>Ancient Chinese legend explaining why pandas are so shy and retiring</em>).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 28-4-2006(6): My<strong> writing brush</strong> is a “bamboo brush”, my handwriting is both supple and tense, like the bamboo.
