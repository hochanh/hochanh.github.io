So on your first birthday, you receive just one <em>shell</em> as a <strong>present</strong>, but the next year it <em>increases</em> to two <em>shells</em> as<strong> presents</strong>, and so on, <em>increasing</em> and <em>increasing</em> so by the time you&#039;re elderly, the number of <em>shells</em> you&#039;ll get as<strong> presents</strong> will have <em>increased</em> to an awful lot of<strong> presents</strong>. GOT IT YET?<strong> PRESENTS</strong> = SHELLS + INCREASE.
