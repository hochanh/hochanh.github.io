1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 14-12-2008(90): You can&#039;t breathe very well, so the doc looks inside your <em>mouth</em> to find the <em>cause</em>. &quot;Oh, I see the <em>cause</em> of your<strong> windpipe</strong> blockage. There&#039;s a St Bernard penned up in there!&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 13-2-2007(30): Imagine a group of <strong>windpipes</strong> chatting: “That <em>mouth</em> is the <em>cause</em> of all my problems, you know, always breathing in germs, etc.”.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 14-6-2010(15): The<strong> windpipe</strong> in your <em>mouth</em> is what <em>causes</em> you to breath.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 30-1-2009(10): Let&#039;s break this kanji down further into a <em>mouth</em> and a <em>mouth with a dog in it</em>. Picture a T-Rex sitting in the waiting room of an Ear, Eye, and Throat Hospital. The TV on the wall has some educational content running: &quot;Here&#039;s a picture of a healthy<strong> windpipe</strong>,&quot; the T-Rex doctor says while pointing to an X-ray of a clear<strong> windpipe</strong>, which looks just like a <em>mouth</em>. &quot;And here&#039;s an X-ray of a <em>windpipe with a dog stuck</em> in it. Don&#039;t let this happen to you!&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fvenegas">fvenegas</a>] 14-1-2012(4): The sounds which come out of your mouth, are caused by your<strong> windpipe</strong>.
