1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 3-2-2008(270): <strong>Mirror</strong> should suggest vanity. Imagine a spoiled girl who gets her parents to buy her a <em>Golden</em><strong> mirror</strong> so she can <em>stand</em> in front of it all <em>day</em> vainly admiring her lovely <em>human legs</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/digicult">digicult</a>] 16-4-2009(23): The <em>metal</em><strong> mirror</strong> makes a <em>sound</em> - it&#039;s answering the question &quot;who has the fairest <em>human legs</em> of all?&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tritonxginnenglish">tritonxginnenglish</a>] 5-10-2006(23): <em>metal + stand up + sun + legs </em> remember the legend of <strong>Amaterasu</strong> who retired in a cave. the other Gods brought a <strong>MIRROR</strong> made of polished <strong> METAL</strong> at the entrance of the cave. Amaterasu who was <strong>STANDING UP</strong> saw her image of the <strong>SUN </strong> and began to dance with her <strong>LEGS</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matt_jenkins">matt_jenkins</a>] 13-4-2008(12): Remember how Archimedes burnt an approaching fleet with<strong> mirror</strong>s?<strong> Mirror</strong>s then were <em>metal</em> and the sailors must have thought: &quot;What&#039;re those <em>metal </em> things up there, <em>standing</em> on the city walls? They look like <em>little suns</em> on <em>human legs</em>. Warm today isn&#039;t it?&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 9-12-2007(11): WARNING: Be extra careful not to confuse the <em>sun/tongue-wagging mouth</em> and <em>human legs</em> part of the<strong> mirror</strong> primitive with 見 <a href="../v4/57.html">see</a> (#57 見).
