1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nilfisq">nilfisq</a>] 25-9-2007(372): She was <strong>beguiled</strong>/<strong>mislead</strong> by his charm: at the party he kissed her on the <em>mouth</em>, they did it on the <em>floor </em>and thus he stole her<em> heart</em>. Poor girl!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 16-1-2006(92): The same cowboy from frame # 356 (elements mouth, floor and fiesta), kisses the floor with his mouth, once again, before going to the fiesta. There, he uses his good looks to<strong> beguile</strong> women (gets them to buy him drinks or such), by playing with their hearts.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 30-4-2009(37): I like to think of this character as Guile from Street Fighter 2, <strong>beguiling</strong> Chun Li at the <em>fiesta</em>. He kisses her on the <em>mouth</em>, they do it on the <em>floor</em>. Then, remembering his job, he rips out her <em>heart</em>, Mortal Kombat style. &quot;which character are you gonna be?&quot; &quot;I&#039;m gonna <strong>be Guile</strong>&quot; (Partly inspired by nilfisq&#039;s).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 23-7-2008(31): This kanji actually means <strong>BEWILDERED</strong>. At the fiesta, he was kissing the floor with all his heart. Everyone was <strong>bewildered</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NickCooper">NickCooper</a>] 5-9-2008(12): At the fiesta I decided to<strong> beguile</strong> the crowd by performing a trick where I pull out my heart and throw it on the ground. It worked, their mouths hit the floor!
