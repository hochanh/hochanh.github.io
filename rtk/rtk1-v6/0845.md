1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 9-11-2005(255): In the case of true<strong> poverty</strong>, not having money is only part of the problem. There are other components as well, like lack of education, class structuring, etc., but that doesn&#039;t really matter. Just remember that the money is only part of it, not the whole.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bokuzukuri">bokuzukuri</a>] 5-1-2006(123): Parting with your money will lead to<strong> poverty</strong>.

Since I imagine <em>part</em> as a section of a pie chart, I&#039;ll think of a pie chart representing the causes of<strong> poverty</strong>. <em>Shells</em> (lack of money) is just one <em>part</em> of the pie chart.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Chocobonstrife">Chocobonstrife</a>] 26-4-2012(26): <strong>Poverty</strong> is having only a PART of the MONEY you need to get by.
