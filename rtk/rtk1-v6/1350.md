1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 10-5-2007(178): Ahh, a fine<strong> sultry</strong> day with my <em>love doll</em> under the hot <em>sun</em>. I think she&#039;s getting a tan!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skinnyneo">skinnyneo</a>] 5-11-2007(71): [from decamer0n] This is the kanji for atsui ( 暑い ) as in hot. If you&#039;ve ever been in Japan in the summer no doubt you have heard hoards of people bellowing &quot;Atsui! Atsui!&quot; Here you are laying with your <em>love doll</em> under the hot <em>sun.</em> Luckily the manufacturers were smart and when the doll got to hot it would bellow &quot;Atsui! It&#039;s so<strong> sultry</strong>!&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 3-12-2008(18): You make a <em>voodoo doll</em> in your own image and set it down under the <em>sun</em>, on a deserted tropical island so you can feel the benefits of<strong> sultry</strong> weather all year round.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nebusoku">nebusoku</a>] 20-8-2009(8): On even the most<strong> sultry</strong> <em>day</em>s, <em>Pinocchio</em> can stand under the hot summer <em>sun</em> and it doesn&#039;t bother him one bit because he&#039;s made of wood!
