1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 7-8-2007(158): Japanese festival <em>floats</em> are often so tall they need <em>wood</em> <strong>scaffolds</strong> to be completed. (<a href="http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5909.html">http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5909.html</a>).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sannomiya">sannomiya</a>] 23-4-2007(34): You need a<strong> SCAFFOLD</strong> made of WOOD to build a FLOAT if it will be several stories high.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RachelleUdell">RachelleUdell</a>] 18-7-2008(30): HINT: Near as I can tell from the Zhongwen site, the figure that Heisig designates as a &quot;float&quot;, actually means &quot;lances broken into pieces&quot; (though there&#039;s a third stroke in the Japanese version of the kanji rather than two in the Chinese), thus I&#039;m using <em>broken into pieces</em> to identify that particular pictograph. STORY: A<strong> scaffold</strong> is made of <em>WOOD BROKEN INTO PIECES</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama">liosama</a>] 7-7-2008(15): Not using Heisigs float. im extending the meaning of my Spear (see previous kanji).Think a VERY LONG SPEAR/TRIDENT (Trident as this is like an ARROW with 3 spikes) or, a LONG SPEAR because its just a SPEAR with TWO extra arrow lengths. STORY:<strong> SCAFFOLD</strong>s&#039; are made of VERY LONG SPEARS&#039;s as tall as TREES that allow us to build huge structures.Tridents allow TRIPLE interlocking between each other, making their use in<strong> SCAFFOLD</strong>S good enough to be able to build structures as strong and naturally perfect as TREES.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dtstutz">dtstutz</a>] 5-9-2008(10): A<strong> scaffold</strong> is where you hang witches. In order to know whether they&#039;re witches or not, you put them on a scale to see whether they whether they weigh more than <strong>wood</strong>, a duck, or other things that <strong>float</strong>, like very small rocks. (Monty Python: Search for the Holy Grail).
