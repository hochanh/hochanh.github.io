1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akimoto">akimoto</a>] 20-6-2006(235): Nine plus a drop<strong> round</strong>s it off to ten!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 16-8-2007(97): Watch out for <a href="../v4/120.html">plump</a> (#120 太). Here Heisig could have added a &quot;t&quot; and we would have had a much better keyword : <strong>rotund</strong>. <strong>Rotund</strong> is more specific than &quot;round&quot; which begs for confusion with <a href="../v4/1811.html">circle</a> (#1811 円). A dictionary search on &quot;fat&quot; or &quot;round&quot; doesn&#039;t yield this kanji, but &quot;rotund&quot; does! Primitive suggestion: the <em>Laughing Buddha</em> is often depicted as a <strong>rotund</strong>, smiling bald man in robes with a largely exposed pot belly stomach (symbolizing plenitude).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aspr8045">aspr8045</a>] 30-1-2009(17): NINE plus a little DROP to <strong>round</strong> up to ten.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blueberry">blueberry</a>] 3-2-2010(15): Cut the tail off of a 9 and it will be<strong> round</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KumaRob">KumaRob</a>] 2-8-2012(11): In nine months a drop of sperm can make a woman very<strong> round</strong>.
