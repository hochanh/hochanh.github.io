1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 16-3-2007(215): The <em>samurai</em> sits on the <em>altar</em> and watches the <strong>slave</strong> <em>rake rice</em> all day.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joesan">joesan</a>] 2-1-2008(95): The samurai from <a href="../v4/1097.html">goodwill</a> (#1097 款) maintains his good mood on his wedding day. He tells his <strong>slave</strong> that he can keep all <em>rice</em> (used for confetti) that he <em>rakes</em> up after the ceremony. Generous Man!!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/playadom">playadom</a>] 16-1-2009(28): The <em>samurai</em> sits on the <em>altar</em> and watches the <strong>slave</strong> sieve rice through a sieve all day.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/woelpad">woelpad</a>] 22-4-2008(11): This is what happens if you anger the gods by jumping up and down the <em>altar</em> (see <a href="../v4/1097.html">goodwill</a> (#1097 款)). The <em>samurai</em> is <em>apprehended</em> (<a href="../v4/1160.html">apprehend</a> (#1160 逮)), turned into a <strong>slave</strong> and made to <em>sieve grains of rice</em> all day, as a punishment for losing his <em>sanity</em> (<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1159">ease/sane</a> (#1159 康)).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 24-11-2007(11): Hmm, SAMURAI and ALTAR makes a good primitive called PALADINS (or Knights Templar if that&#039;s your thing). SIEVE was already set up. So, the PALADINS went on a quest to the holy land, there they caught in a SIEVE set by the moors and became<strong> SLAVE</strong>S in the holy land (picture Costner at the beginning of Robin Hood).
