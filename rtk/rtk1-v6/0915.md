1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saranich">saranich</a>] 19-11-2006(342): An<strong> intelligent</strong> man is neither slave to his crotch nor to money. But an<strong> intelligent</strong> slave will know how to use his/her crotch to make money.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shizuru">Shizuru</a>] 12-8-2007(93): Every<strong> intelligent</strong> man is a <em>slave</em> to two things, his: 1) <em>crotch</em>, and 2) <em>money</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(32): An<strong> intelligent</strong> slave hides shells (money) in his crotch (in the crotch of his buttocks, say) so that one day maybe he can buy his freedom. Note: do not confuse with FRAME 459 “cleverness” (in which Heisig suggested the image of a fox associated with the idea of “alert, quick”). This key word here refers in fact to “wise” but Heisig probably chose<strong> intelligent</strong> to avoid confusion later with “wisdom” (so try to think of<strong> intelligent</strong> in the sense of someone wise).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 2-7-2008(27): Tip: The <em>slave + crotch</em> combination appears five times in Heisig. It may be worth making a new primitive. I suggest <em>loincloth</em>, which the <em>slaves</em> wear to cover their <em>crotch</em>. Ref: <a href="../v4/852.html">intelligent</a> (#852 賢), <a href="../v4/853.html">strict</a> (#853 堅), <a href="../v4/1374.html">tense</a> (#1374 緊), <a href="../v4/2453.html">kidney</a> (#2453 腎), <a href="../v4/2618.html">longness</a> (#2618 竪).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mikemorr">mikemorr</a>] 9-4-2009(26): &quot;Slave&quot; plus &quot;crotch&quot; is the character 臤, which apparently means &quot;hard&quot; or &quot;wise&quot;. I like Katsuo&#039;s idea of calling it &quot;loincloth&quot; (something a slave might wear to cover his crotch). The<strong> intelligent</strong> slave used his <em>loincloth</em> to hide some of the master&#039;s <em>shells</em>.
