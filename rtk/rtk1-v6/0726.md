1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 13-10-2005(247): A <em>muchacho</em> <strong>puts up a notice</strong> that says “NO FINGER SNAPPING ALLOWED. MUCHACHOS ON SIESTA”. The muchachos are sleeping soundly, completely oblivious to the sound of dogs barking, guitar playing and even gun shots. Now imagine one tourist passing by and snapping his <em>fingers</em> and waking up all the <em>muchachos</em> at once.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 13-4-2008(148): Just as I was finished <strong>putting up</strong> a &quot;no <em>siestas</em>&quot; <strong>notice</strong> on my property, a muchacho gave me the <em>finger</em>, sat down, and promptly fell asleep.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BigAmish">BigAmish</a>] 15-8-2008(25): The Mexican piano tutor <strong>PUT UP A NOTICE</strong> that his <em>FINGERS</em> were tired and that he was going to take an extended <em>SIESTA</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elanlan">elanlan</a>] 18-6-2009(14): I used a <em>finger</em> and a thumbtack to<strong> put up</strong> a sign on my door to notify others that I was taking a <em>siesta</em> and was not to be disturbed. <strong>(think finger = thumb[tack] and this kanji is easy)</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nilfisq">nilfisq</a>] 29-8-2007(10): Keep your <em>fingers</em> crossed when you go to a shop in Italy: you might see the shop owner <strong>putting up a notice</strong>: &quot;closed because of <em>siesta</em>&quot;.
