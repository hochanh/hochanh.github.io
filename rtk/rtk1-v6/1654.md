1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mhheie">mhheie</a>] 6-2-2008(147): &quot;Once in a<strong> blue</strong> <em>moon</em>&quot; refers to a rare event. But originally &quot;blue moon&quot; refers to a full moon, in other words a fully <em>grown-up</em> moon. Whether once a month is rare or not depends on what we&#039;re talking about, but that happens to be the origin of the expression.
