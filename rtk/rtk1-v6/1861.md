1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mhheie">mhheie</a>] 4-1-2007(183): A twist on greenapple: The teacher puts a tophat on all pupils with gramatically correct<strong> sentence</strong>s, while the rest are left with a big red X on their homework.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/greenapple">greenapple</a>] 2-5-2006(60): The teacher in the tophat puts an X on all the grammatically incorrect<strong> sentence</strong>s.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 31-3-2008(34): I celebrated finishing the Heisig books by buying myself a <em>plaid top hat</em> (<em>top hat</em> with <em>criss cross</em> pattern to symbolize the crisscrossing flashcards) and then I began the AJATT<strong> sentence</strong> method.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 26-10-2007(14): It should not be a problem to see this as<strong> SENTENCE</strong>. For the primitive, think in a Scottish accent and say &quot;PLAID kilt&quot;. Guess it can look like a Beret wearing scot.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meredithcat">meredithcat</a>] 28-7-2010(10): I&#039;m making <strong>sentence/plaid</strong> into a new primitive: <strong>Catholic schoolgirl</strong>. (This should be fun.) // All of the Catholic schoolgirls wear uniforms with <em>top hats</em> and <em>plaid</em> skirts, and sit in school practicing their<strong> sentence</strong>s.
