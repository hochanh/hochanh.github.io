1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 17-4-2007(298): I love <em>Bruce Lee</em> dubbing. His <strong>lips</strong> move, but sometimes words don&#039;t come out of his <em>mouth</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 12-7-2009(47): <em>Bruce Lee</em> says &quot;Read my<strong> lips</strong>...&quot;, but when I try to, his <em>mouth</em> isn&#039;t moving with the dialogue.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rich_f">rich_f</a>] 16-8-2007(21): As I approached her <strong>lips</strong>, I began to sense <em>the sign of the dragon</em> breath coming from her <em>mouth</em>, and I almost fainted.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stupiddog">stupiddog</a>] 30-12-2009(12): (Positioning) <em>Bruce Lee</em> prefers the <strong>lips</strong> of his girlfriend&#039;s <em>mouth</em> &quot;down below&quot;. Lucky bastard!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aeryon">Aeryon</a>] 20-1-2012(5): Bruce Lee comes flying out of nowhere and kicks you right in the mouth... leaving you with fat<strong> lips</strong>.
