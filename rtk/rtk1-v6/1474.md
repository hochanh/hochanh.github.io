1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jaresty">jaresty</a>] 14-11-2007(147): Whenever <em>Venom</em> is<strong> tense</strong>, he loses control of his sex drive and becomes a <em>slave</em> to his <em>crotch</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall">pmbeddall</a>] 17-1-2008(65): You&#039;d be<strong> tense</strong> too if you were a <em>slave</em> and your owner removed the <em>threads</em> covering your <em>crotch</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DavidZ">DavidZ</a>] 28-9-2009(55): TIP: This is the first kanji in &quot;kinbaku&quot; ( 緊縛 ), the art of Japanese rope bondage. STORY: The <em>slave&#039;s</em> <em>crotch</em> is tied up with rope (<em>thread</em>) to heighten the sado-erotic <strong>tension</strong>... 緊張 [きんちょう].

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cbogart">cbogart</a>] 10-2-2007(21): The crotch-slave from &quot;intelligent&quot; this time has hidden some thread as part of her elaborate plan to escape from her owner. Now she&#039;s being searched, and is afraid they&#039;ll find where she hid the thread -- she is quite<strong> tense</strong>, and it shows.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/busaiku">busaiku</a>] 13-11-2009(14): <em>Spiderman</em> is <em>slave</em> to his <em>crotch</em>, literally, because of that leotard he uses. If he get&#039;s just a little too excited in public, the situation would become very<strong> tense</strong> (if you know what I mean).
