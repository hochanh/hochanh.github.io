1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 20-1-2008(222): Distinguish from <a href="../v4/501.html">formerly</a> (#501 曽). Think of<strong> previously</strong> as &quot;the previous customer&quot; in a restaurant. At a cheap sleazy diner, the <em>waitress</em> gives you unwashed <em>silver</em>ware that was<strong> previously</strong> used by the previous customer. Yuck.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 8-1-2008(78): For the waitress primitive, I don&#039;t really see the receipt. So instead, I imagine a waitress holding a plate above her head, using those legs to weave through the tables.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jotun">jotun</a>] 2-6-2008(31): <strong>Previously</strong> on The Silver Surfer. The Silver Surfer took the <em>Silver Waitress</em> back to his place. Now we get to see what happens next.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 14-1-2007(28): <strong>Previously</strong> -&gt; <strong>previews</strong> at the movies. Almost all the actresses on the <em>silver</em> screen<strong> previously</strong> were <em>waitresses</em>. Story by mspertus.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 20-6-2007(24): <strong>Previously</strong>, we left some <em>silver</em> on the table for the <em>waitress</em>.
