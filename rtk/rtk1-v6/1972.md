I apologize in advance for this one, ladies, but if I don&#039;t make this story memorable this kanji will haunt me forever. Ok, here goes:<strong> Marriage</strong> is the day a <em>woman</em> is changed forever. Not only does she get a new <em>family name</em> but she can start using her <em>mouth with a wagging tongue</em> to nag instead of those other unspeakable acts that her husband used to enjoy..
