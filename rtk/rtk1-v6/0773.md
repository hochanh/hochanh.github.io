1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 1-11-2007(171): When you&#039;re<strong> suspicious</strong>, your state of mind twists round and round like a spool of thread.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura">vosmiura</a>] 4-6-2007(85): Imagine a loud farting sound on The Enterprise (sorry). Everyone looks around trying to find who did it. The one looking most<strong> suspicious</strong> is <em>Data</em>. His <em>soiled crotch</em> gives him away.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 18-2-2008(67): Suggestion: Replace &quot;spool&quot; with &quot;toilet paper/roll&quot;. Reason: See my note at <a href="../v4/715.html">stalk</a> (#715 茎). Story: <em>Sigmund Freud</em> (= state of mind) has a mystery patient who has wrapped himself entirely in <em>toilet paper</em>. Freud is very<strong> suspicious</strong> that it&#039;s someone he knows (who wants to remain anonymous). Spool also appears in <a href="../v4/715.html">stalk</a> (#715 茎), <a href="../v4/717.html">lightly</a> (#717 軽), <a href="../v4/882.html">diameter</a> (#882 径), <a href="../v4/1360.html">sutra</a> (#1360 経).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethg">sethg</a>] 17-3-2009(46): The girl&#039;s <em>state of mind</em> certainly became<strong> suspicious</strong> when she found a lot of used <em>toilet paper</em> in the waste basket beside her boyfriend&#039;s computer...

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 16-1-2009(23): Captain Picard notices a<strong> suspicious</strong> smell coming from <em>Data</em>. Picard turns to Riker and asks &quot;What on earth is that awful stench, Number One?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; says Riker, pointing to Data&#039;s <em>soiled crotch</em>. &quot;I think it&#039;s number two.&quot; (thanks vosmiura).
