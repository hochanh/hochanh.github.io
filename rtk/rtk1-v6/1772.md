1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 1-5-2006(168): Mr. T is certainly an<strong> ADMIRABLE</strong> PERSON, so much so that parents are buying lockets with his picture in it and having their children wear them like amulets.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 21-2-2008(79): For <em>locket</em>: The <em>locket</em> (<em>key</em> dangling from something, the vertical stroke) opens like a <em>mouth</em>, but you need a jeweler&#039;s <em>monocle</em> to make out the pictures within. ----- <em>Dracula</em> survives a staking attempt when the <em>locket</em> with Mina&#039;s<strong> admirable</strong> picture deflects the blow. &quot;It was an<strong> admirable</strong> attempt,&quot; he admits as he sucks his attacker&#039;s blood.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 21-1-2008(52): <strong>Stroke order:</strong> Heisig says that the added vertical stroke is the third stroke, but it&#039;s the first of primitive (so it&#039;s the third of <em>this</em> kanji, but in the book he&#039;s talking about the primitive).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 23-5-2007(39): She thought that <em>Mr. T</em> was a tough, heartless guy, but then she found out that he carries around a <em>locket</em> with a picture of his daughter. Suddenly, she found it<strong> admirable</strong> that he had such a soft side.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brose">brose</a>] 17-2-2007(14): Hint: <em>locket</em> = <a href="../v4/17.html">I</a> (#17 吾) + <em>sunglasses with one of the lenses popped out</em> with the top line of 五 left off. <strong>えらい</strong>。.
