2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lilpea">lilpea</a>] 3-8-2007(50): It takes but one <em>drop</em> from the most special <em>water</em>: the fountain of youth (and it is written in a special way to with an extra horizontal line on the top) to live for an<strong> eternity</strong>. (In order to remember that the drop is at the top, think that the drop must come from the topmost water in order for its effects to be true).
