1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberstuber">uberstuber</a>] 21-6-2007(205): I put all those useless <em>business cards</em> at the<strong> bottom</strong> of a <em>cave</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FudoMyo">FudoMyo</a>] 8-5-2007(93): At the<strong> bottom</strong> of the <em>cave</em> you find a <em>meishi</em>: &quot;LOST? DIAL 1-800-...&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joxn_costello">joxn_costello</a>] 31-1-2009(36): In the deepest<strong> bottom</strong> of this <em>cave</em> complex, spelunkers leave their <em>calling cards</em> to prove they made it all the way.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Weber">Weber</a>] 28-2-2007(19): Its unlikely for you to have a card if you&#039;re low in society. People living in caves must be at the<strong> bottom</strong> of society, so they sure as hell don&#039;t have one.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/faded">faded</a>] 23-1-2010(13): You know you&#039;ve hit <strong>rock<strong> bottom</strong></strong> when you have to operate your business out of a <em>cave</em>. All you have left are a few <em>business cards</em>, and you&#039;re desperately hoping someone calls and offers you business.
