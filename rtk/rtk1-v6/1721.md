When you accept a risky quest like hunting for the <em>head</em> of some evil monster. You should<strong> deposit</strong> your money (<em>shells</em>) <em>beforehand</em>, so that when you die you don&#039;t lose all of your wealth.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak">wrightak</a>] 6-3-2008(17): In Japan, instead of sending your statements in the mail, you are given a small book that you can insert into the ATMs and all activity will be printed inside. One of the few good things that Japanese banks do. When<strong> deposit</strong>ing money at an ATM, you must open your book to the right <em>page</em> and insert <em>beforehand</em> to have a record of the<strong> deposit</strong> written in.
