1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eriklc">eriklc</a>] 20-11-2005(209): Like the saying goes,<strong> Hate</strong> just begets<strong> Hate</strong>. A state of mind that just increases and increases until it explodes.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rivvie">Rivvie</a>] 17-2-2008(85): Your <em>state of mind</em> would turn to<strong> hate</strong> when someone would take away a loved one that was <em>formerly</em> yours.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 8-8-2007(55): <em>Data</em>&#039;s one true emotion is <strong>hate</strong> for <em>Prince&#039;s</em> music. (Image: Data hunched over hands to his ears and screaming while Picard bobs to Purple Rain).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Captain+Kanjipants">Captain+Kanjipants</a>] 7-8-2011(47): <strong>Hate</strong> is the <em>state of mind</em> that turned the man who was <em>formerly</em> Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 11-10-2005(22): <strong>Hate</strong> is unfortunately a <em>state of mind</em> on the <em>increase</em> in today&#039;s society. You may picture<strong> hate</strong> as a green face with red eyes, multiplying wildly (see frame 501 “formerly”). If the mnemonic doesn&#039;t do the job, add the <em>state-of-mind</em> switch.
