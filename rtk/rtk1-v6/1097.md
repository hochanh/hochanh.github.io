1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal">captal</a>] 27-4-2008(497): Half Way!!!!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 19-6-2006(223): This is a &quot;<em>design</em>&quot; as in a &quot;pattern&quot;, not a verb as in &quot;to <em>design</em>&quot;. The <strong>tree</strong> grain <em>design</em> was too expensive for the <strong>third class</strong> airline to use for the panelling. They just painted it.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 29-4-2008(200): Makes me think of Ikea. Everything is <em>wooden</em> and the<strong> design</strong> is really nice but the quality really is <em>third rate.</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rptb1">rptb1</a>] 11-11-2005(58): The third class seats on the train are very simply<strong> design</strong>ed. In fact, they&#039;re not<strong> design</strong>ed at all. They&#039;re just wooden stumps of trees.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matt_jenkins">matt_jenkins</a>] 12-4-2008(23): <strong>DESIGN</strong> makes me think of &#039;intelligent<strong> design</strong>&#039;, the <em>third class</em> alternative to evolution for the hard-of-thinking. You&#039;d have to have solid <em>wood</em> between your ears to believe it!
