1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snallygaster">snallygaster</a>] 7-10-2007(162): Since the meaning of &quot;big dipper&quot; is rather specific and the sense of measurement seems to be a more common usage, I concentrate on the primative meaning of <strong>measuring cup</strong>. This is a pictograph, with the first two strokes representing the measuring ticks on the side of the cup.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 10-10-2008(98): Is it just me, or do all of these traditional kanji pictographs look like they were drawn by a retarded bunny rabbit?

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 4-1-2010(30): I looked out my window frame and saw two shooting stars slashing through the<strong> big dipper</strong>. Primitive: Big Gulp cup from 7-11.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/igordesu">igordesu</a>] 13-1-2009(22): This does not look like the<strong> big dipper</strong> or 18 liters of anything in any way, shape, or form.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meiko452">meiko452</a>] 11-11-2010(11): The<strong> Big Dipper</strong> is a celestial measuring cup.
