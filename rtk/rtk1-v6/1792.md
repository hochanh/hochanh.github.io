Well, my cheapskate dad wanted to add a fresh coat of white<strong> paint</strong> to our house. He bought the biggest, cheapest tub, placed it on a scale in our yard, and started diluting it with water. It was working fine, and he was adding water drop by drop and carefully checking the weight each time. However, his hand slipped, and he added <em>too much water</em> and the <em>scale broke down violently</em>, spilling the<strong> paint</strong> <em>all over the ground</em>.
