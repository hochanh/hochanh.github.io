1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mikes">mikes</a>] 7-5-2007(239): I burn the CANDLE in my HOUSE until the<strong> WEE HOURS</strong> reviewing the kanji!!!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD">PeterJD</a>] 3-4-2008(87): I agree with elktapestry. This kanji really means &quot;early evening&quot;, not &quot;wee hours&quot; [Heisig really should have done his homework on this and several other characters (e.g., #145 &quot;but of course&quot; -- what the hell???). Oh well.] &quot;Every <em>house</em> lights <em>candles</em> in the EARLY EVENING which stay lit until the<strong> wee hours</strong>&quot;. E.G. 宵の口 （よいのくち）early evening; 今宵 （こよい）this evening; tonight.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry">elktapestry</a>] 27-3-2007(55): The fixed definition of this Kanji that Hesig gives seems deceptive and misleading. This not only refers to<strong> wee hours</strong> of the morning but also Evening and Early Night. So it seems to span the whole range of times when one might need a candle to work within the confines of one&#039;s house without daylight. Shows me that I can never trust one source of information exclusively, especially not Hesig. I thank him for this sytem of memorization, but still...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 8-2-2007(12): In the log <em>house</em> the <strong>wee hours</strong> are spent studying by <em>candle</em>light.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/krungthep">krungthep</a>] 9-5-2008(5): In the<strong> wee hours</strong> I usually stay at <em>home</em> lit by a <em>candle</em> playing with my <em>little</em> bit of <em>flesh</em> until it bears <em>resemblance</em> to a <em>candle</em>.
