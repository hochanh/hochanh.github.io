1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shizuru">Shizuru</a>] 24-8-2007(196): I find the best way of memorizing this kanji is in conjunction with the Japanese compound for <strong>ninja</strong>: 忍者 -- i.e.<strong> someone</strong> who <strong>endures</strong> (see FRAME 597 for the kanji 忍 ). A 忍者 is not just a 身 (somebody), it&#039;s 者 who can 忍 great 拷 !

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 20-1-2007(72): Back in the <em>day</em>, the <em>old man</em> used to be<strong> someone</strong>. His name was in the papers and all that. I use CHUCKY from the movie Child&#039;s Play as my major alternate meaning for this primitive.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 25-11-2009(42): An <em>old man</em> is<strong> someone</strong> who has seen many <em>days</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 14-3-2007(32): The <em>old man</em> who desperately wanted a <em>son</em> (<em>sun</em>) was Gepetto. He just wanted<strong> someone</strong> to love. As a primitive, this character will mean <em>Pinocchio</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 12-9-2009(18): [aircawn] Back in the <em>day</em>, the <em>old man</em> used to be<strong> someone</strong>. He was famous for being the world&#039;s number one puppet manufacturer. (let the &quot;one&quot; be your way to differentiate this between the kanji for &#039;somebody&#039;).
