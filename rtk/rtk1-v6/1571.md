1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 28-10-2007(227): Since trees eat through their<strong> root</strong>s, one could imagine<strong> root</strong>s as <em>tree silver</em>ware.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 1-3-2007(109): The <strong>root</strong>s of the magical <em>tree</em> are <em>silver</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 18-6-2006(42): In the kanji for<strong> root</strong> (not the primitive), I imagine a <em>tree</em> whose<strong> root</strong>s end up in <em>silverware</em>, which the <em>tree</em> uses somehow to eat whatever is underground.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Weber">Weber</a>] 21-2-2007(22): Think of how if you look at the<strong> root</strong>s of many trees, they are not brown like the rest of the trunk, they sometimes are a whitish, silver color, because they are full of water and nutrients, rather than course cellulose like what is needed up top to protect from the elements.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 22-7-2009(18): The <em>tree</em> with <em>silver</em> on it (the Christmas tree) has NO<strong> root</strong>s.
