2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 18-11-2007(109): I had to take <em>one</em> day off from work due to &#039;personal<strong> matter</strong>s&#039; after stepping on a <em>rake</em> and having the handle snap up and smack me across the <em>mouth</em>. I certainly wasn&#039;t going to tell anyone about it.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 23-2-2009(49): This IS a laughing<strong> matter</strong>: <em>One mouth</em> getting smacked after someone steps on a <em>rake</em> - classic slapstick comedy!
