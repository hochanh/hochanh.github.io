1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 4-7-2007(178): Errata: stroke order in 4th edition is wrong. Top stroke is first.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 16-5-2008(104): The<strong> axe</strong>-wielding maniac <em>nails</em> a poor victim, right under a <em>cliff</em>. Blood everywhere! (thanks scottamus!).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ramchip">Ramchip</a>] 28-5-2008(41): Warning: unlike the nail primitive, notice that the<strong> axe</strong> does not have a hook on the last stroke.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jinkouchinou">jinkouchinou</a>] 9-8-2009(18): The<strong> axe</strong>-wielding maniac nails a poor victim, right under a cliff. Blood everywhere! (thanks scottamus!). [Shibo] Errata: stroke order in 4th edition is wrong. Top stroke is first. [radical_tyro] Warning: unlike the nail primitive, notice that the<strong> axe</strong> does not have a hook on the last stroke. [Ramchip] I just wanted to combine these as they were all very helpful. I take no credit for any of them.
