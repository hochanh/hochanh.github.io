1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 14-10-2007(106): If you arrive with <em>two swords</em> at the <em>city walls</em>, expect some<strong> interrogative</strong>s before they&#039;ll let you in.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/woelpad">woelpad</a>] 28-8-2008(9): <strong>Interrogation</strong> at the <em>city walls</em>: &quot;Any weapons, <strong>question mark</strong>.&quot; &quot;Just a <em>blade</em>.&quot; &quot;Why the <em>two</em> scratches on the <em>blade</em>, <strong>question mark</strong>.&quot; &quot;To remind me that I cut off my other ear too, <em>exclamation mark</em> (<a href="../v4/2680.html">exclamation</a> (#2680 耶)).&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 27-3-2010(8): Phonetic ナ. If a trespasser attempts to cross the <em>city walls</em>, the guards will likely employ the<strong> interrogative</strong> approach of pointing a <em>double-edged sword</em> at them. Sort of shorthand for &quot;Who goes there?&quot;. Note: &quot;two&quot; is written before final stroke of 刀 .

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 23-3-2011(5): Mix of Katsuo and Gavmck: If you arrive at the <em>city walls</em>, get some<strong> interrogative</strong>s from the guards, and say that you have <em>two swords</em>, they will probably say: &quot;ナ(Nah), you can&#039;t enter.&quot; Reading = ナ.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mirnkaya">mirnkaya</a>] 20-7-2012(1): (thanks Katsuo) If you arrive with <em>two swords</em> at the <em>city walls</em>, expect some<strong> interrogative</strong>s before they&#039;ll let you in, unless your the master of the armory that is... (this character is used chiefly now for its sound ナ. only common word using this kanji 旦那 (だんな) -- master/patron).
