2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 19-1-2007(96): A little like a <em>calendar</em>, your <strong>CV</strong> records your <em>footsteps</em> through time.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 17-10-2011(91): A<strong> curriculum</strong> (vitae) is similar to a <em>calendar</em> except that, instead of mentioning every <em>day</em> in your life, it only mentions the main <em>stop</em>s. (Compare <a href="../v4/213.html">calendar</a> (#213 暦)).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 25-8-2007(25): Stop underneath a grove of trees by the cliffs to sit down and write your CV.
