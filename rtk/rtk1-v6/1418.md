How better to remember it ? Prudes please get over yourselves. If someone has a good story, just because you are easily offended, doesn&#039;t mean someone else( the majority ) won&#039;t find it useful. planning to be missionaries in Japan with all your Kanji skillz ? If you find this offensive...hahahaha. You will get a shock when you see your first KONBINI magazine shelf.LMAO..i gotsreported.
