1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35">ruuku35</a>] 1-6-2007(299): A<strong> PADDY-RIDGE</strong> divides the RICE FIELD in HALF.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama">MeisterLlama</a>] 20-1-2009(65): Better keyword: waterside (as in lakeside, etc.) words: 河畔 (riverside) 湖畔 (lakeside), 池畔 (by a pond), etc. New keyword captures most common meaning, and avoids confusion with 畦 , which means ONLY<strong> paddy-ridge</strong>. story: A rice field is divided in half, half is field half is water. If you stand at the halfway mark, you are at the waterside.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 13-12-2006(35): Think about a large <em>rice field</em> as a big square. Then you draw a line down the middle, <em>halving</em> it into two. Then you draw a line across the middle, <em>halving</em> it again into four... These halvings are <strong>paddy-ridges</strong> that separate the rice field into separate sections. I dunno the reason why, but that&#039;s how it&#039;s done.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Garland">Garland</a>] 25-7-2010(3): If you keep dividing the <em>rice paddy</em> in <em>half</em>, and in <em>half</em> again, and again, you&#039;ll get more and more <strong>paddy-ridges</strong>.
