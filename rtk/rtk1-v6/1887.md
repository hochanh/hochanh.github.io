1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Copycatken">Copycatken</a>] 30-6-2006(301): The <em>salad</em> did not look very appetizing... The <em>sprouts</em> were<strong> yellow</strong> and there were <em>animal legs</em> sticking out of it.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thora">Thora</a>] 22-8-2007(48): I order a <em>salad</em> with <em>sprouts</em>. I&#039;m asked if I&#039;d like to add chicken. Yes please. My salad then arrives . . . . topped with these horribly gnarled<strong> yellow</strong> things. Chicken feet! (<em>animal legs</em>) ugh.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TheSlakey">TheSlakey</a>] 31-12-2008(36): My face turned<strong> yellow</strong> when I watched my salad sprout animal legs and start scurrying across the table. Check please!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Angrybeez">Angrybeez</a>] 24-6-2008(16): The salad goes<strong> yellow</strong> sprouts legs and runs off.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/GKKLJapan">GKKLJapan</a>] 18-7-2011(11): Anyone who&#039;s played Final Fantasy knows what a Chocobo is. Chocobos have<strong> YELLOW</strong> plumage and strong ANIMAL LEGS. They are also fond of eating SPROUTS, which has led to the promotion of various Chocobo SALADS.
