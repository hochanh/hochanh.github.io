1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ithil">ithil</a>] 5-4-2007(133): <strong>Parking</strong> in the dark may be difficult...specially if you&#039;re<strong> parking</strong> a <em>trojan horse</em>. To lend you a tiny bit of help, take this <em>candlestick</em> with you, and at least you&#039;ll have some light.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sweetneet">sweetneet</a>] 21-1-2007(63): In the olden days<strong> parking</strong> lots used to have reserved spaces for where the <em>lord</em> (of the set of houses, shops, whatever) could park his <em>team of horses</em>. nowadays it&#039;s pretty much the same...reserved<strong> parking</strong> in front for the big bosses&#039; cars....

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laner36">laner36</a>] 25-4-2008(45): (Heard inside the belly of the trojan horse) &quot;But the sign says No <em>Trojan Horse</em><strong> Parking</strong>, m&#039;<em>lord</em> .&quot; (Think monty python skit).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 6-10-2008(29): A <em>lord</em> gets valet<strong> parking</strong> for his <em>horse</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zodiac">zodiac</a>] 22-8-2009(21): In the olden days you had to park your <em>horse</em> next to a <em>candlestick</em>, a primitive<strong> parking</strong> meter that you start by lighting a fire and tracks the time by burning down.
