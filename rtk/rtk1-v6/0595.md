1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 4-12-2006(270): The <em>mouth</em> of a <em>turkey</em> is used<strong> solely</strong> for saying, &quot;Gobble.&quot; Likewise, your <em>mouth</em>, full of <em>turkey</em>, is<strong> solely</strong> used to gobble it up.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Howdoken">Howdoken</a>] 7-1-2008(113): Sadly my <em>mouth</em> gets to taste <em>turkey</em><strong> solely</strong> on Christmas Day.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 13-2-2008(64): &quot;We can&#039;t prosecutre the murderer based<strong> solely</strong> on what comes from the mouth of this turkey!&quot; Imagine a turkey who witnessed a murder of his fellow kind (to be eaten) and trying to report it to the cops.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/diracbracket">diracbracket</a>] 9-1-2011(50): To be remembered in conjunction with its virtual synonym &quot;only&quot;. All we need to remember is this: &quot;only&quot; gets the <em>turkey</em>&#039;s legs, and<strong> solely</strong> gets the rest of the <em>turkey</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Green_Airplane">Green_Airplane</a>] 25-6-2008(31): Remember the episode of Friends, when no one except Joey wanted turkey for thanksgiving? Joey insisted, &quot;what kind of thanksgiving would it be without a turkey?&quot; so Monica agreed to make one, if he could eat it all by himself. A whole <em>turkey</em> <strong>solely</strong> for the <em>mouth</em> of Joey Tribbiani! Just picture him sitting there, with a huge <em>turkey</em> on the table in front of him, stuffing it in his <em>mouth</em>. If I recall correctly, he still had some space left for the desert!
