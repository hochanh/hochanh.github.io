1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak">wrightak</a>] 6-6-2006(518): Pinnochio gets frustrated that every time he utters a <em>word</em> of a<strong> lie</strong>, his nose grows and he has to get the <em>saw</em> out again.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb">jameserb</a>] 23-4-2008(44): Her<strong> lie</strong>s are words that cut not like a knife, no not cleanly, but savagely like a saw.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Piitaa">Piitaa</a>] 3-7-2006(23): Hint: I think of<strong> lie</strong>s as <em>serrated words</em> for some reason.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 24-11-2008(12): This really has the connotation of fraud rather than<strong> lie</strong> but the Pinnochio story works too well.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nicjsb">nicjsb</a>] 3-10-2008(8): His words were false; I saw right through his<strong> lie</strong>.
