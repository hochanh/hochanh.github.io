1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 30-4-2007(208): (re: dingomick) &quot;These are your<strong> orders</strong>,&quot; declares the general while passing out documents at the <em>meeting</em>. As everyone started to leave, the general exclaims &quot;Oh wait! I need to certify these<strong> orders</strong>!&quot; and went around stamping each paper with his personal <em>chop-seal</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 28-2-2007(73): &quot;These are your <strong>orders</strong>,&quot; declares the general at the <em>meeting</em> as he stamps them with his <em>chop-seal</em>. (Primitive: chop-seal imaged as a papal ring, the one&#039;s they would press into wax as their official seal. Also a cattle brand.).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama">MeisterLlama</a>] 29-4-2009(52): Take note that this is written differently from how it looks in the typed font.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lerris">lerris</a>] 4-7-2007(36): I assigned this the primitive meaning of President Bush, giving crazy<strong> orders</strong> and letting everything go to his head.
