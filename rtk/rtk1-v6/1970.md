1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 12-11-2007(239): Looks a bit like Ft =&gt; <strong>F</strong>amily <strong>t</strong>itle =&gt;<strong> Family name</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 19-10-2006(75): The <strong>family name</strong> is important to me! <em>Drop</em> me from a building, torture me with a <em>fishhook</em>, I&#039;m keeping my <em>one</em> <strong>family name</strong>. Hook me with a second <em>fishhook</em>, I refuse to change my <strong>family name</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 20-8-2007(43): This <em>box</em> is full of <em>arrows</em>. <em>Arrows</em> are special: armorer&#039;s <strong>family name</strong> is engraved on each arrowhead (hence last <em>dot</em> is left out).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dilandau24">dilandau24</a>] 28-11-2006(27): Note that the stroke order of this is <em>drop</em>, <em>fishhook</em>, <em>one</em> (<strong>written as normal</strong>, not right to left as Heisig writes) then the second <em>fishhook</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hujis">Hujis</a>] 11-5-2009(14): Hook, is both Hook&#039;s (from Peter Pan) first name and<strong> family name</strong>. So he&#039;s called <em>Hook Hook</em>. But he thought that was a bit silly so he <em>droped</em> the second hook and only uses <em>one</em>.
