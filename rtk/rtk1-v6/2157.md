1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 12-1-2006(112): In this kanji, &quot;<em>deer</em>&quot; replaces the &quot;head&quot; primitive from the &quot;melancholy&quot; kanji. Poor Ned is feeling melancholy so Uncle Jimbo (of South Park animated series) suggests a good <em>deer</em> huntin&#039; trip to fix that and turn that <em>melancholy</em> into<strong> jubilation</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adrianbarritt">adrianbarritt</a>] 5-9-2007(96): <em>Bambi</em> was <em>melancholy</em> at the death of his mother, but is now in<strong> jubilation</strong> as he&#039;s made friends with thumper.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/onsen_monkey">onsen_monkey</a>] 18-9-2006(60): This kanji shows the<strong> JUBILATION</strong> that accompanies the modern holiday of Christmas. Rather than focus on the MELANCHOLY events of Christ&#039;s crucifiction (as we do on Easter), on Christmas we focus on the arrival of RUDOLPH to bring us lots of presents. Oh yeah, I guess there&#039;s a small bit of<strong> JUBILATION</strong> about Christ&#039;s birth too, but fuck that shit, I just want presents.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 25-11-2008(47): Hamlet&#039;s melancholy turns at once to<strong> jubilation</strong> when he discovers that his head has transformed into that of a deer&#039;s. No more will human tragedy be his source of suffering!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Green_Airplane">Green_Airplane</a>] 7-8-2008(25): The<strong> Jubilation</strong> of Haruhi Suzumiya. Here we have Haruhi, from <a href="../v4/616.html">melancholy</a> (#616 憂) of Haruhi Suzumiya feeling so <strong>jubilant</strong> (for a change) she&#039;s wearing an absurd <em>deer</em> mask over her head. (she only needs some horse costume to go with it, and the image of 馬鹿 is complete).
