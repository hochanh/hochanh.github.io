1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cerulean">cerulean</a>] 19-5-2008(157): A<strong> month</strong> is longer than a day.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry">elktapestry</a>] 21-3-2007(60): Am I the only one who sees this as someone sticking their ass in the air &quot;mooning&quot; someone (two cheeks of the butt and the legs coming off of it)? The Moon meaning connects well to the meaning of<strong> month</strong>, considering that<strong> month</strong>s were traditionally measured by the phases of the moon. Also, the mooning &quot;ass&quot; part of it connects well to Hesig&#039;s seemingly unconnected &quot;flesh&quot; or &quot;part of the body&quot; meaning (when used in primitive form).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gaijingo">gaijingo</a>] 16-6-2006(15): <strong>Month</strong> - every MOON cycle, werewolves eat FLESH, and other PARTs OF THE BODY.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tsuki56">Tsuki56</a>] 6-6-2009(12): Once a<strong> month</strong>, the moon is full.
