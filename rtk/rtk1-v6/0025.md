1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/atomiton">atomiton</a>] 25-9-2006(469): If you work from Sun UP to Sun DOWN you will be<strong> prosperous</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cutiehuni">cutiehuni</a>] 14-2-2009(76): I kept getting this mixed up with meanings like &#039;fortune&#039;, so here is a fool proof story! Remember the Vulcan salute from &#039;Star Trek&#039; (a fiction of the sci-fi genre in which heavenly bodies such as SUNS play a huge role) used with the phrase &#039;live long and PROSPER&#039;? If that&#039;s not enough of a visual reminder, the Vulcan salute shows the fingers parted in to 2 sets of 2, and visually kind of looks like this kanji if you think about it.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ladymcBeth">ladymcBeth</a>] 27-8-2007(38): When you are<strong> prosperous</strong>, your gold shines as brightly as two suns.

(Thanks for the idea adhmm, for a while I have had trouble remembering which sun is biggest. Got it now!).
