3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johanvg">johanvg</a>] 21-7-2006(28): <strong>Grave</strong>s are in the soil beneath the<strong> grave</strong>yard.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cirion">Cirion</a>] 30-6-2008(21): The <em>flower</em>s were blooming, the <em>sun</em> was shining, when I let my St. Bernard off his leash and he lifted his leg and peed ON some freshly turned <em>soil</em> that was dug out for a<strong> grave</strong>. [Thanks to dwhitman for the idea of the peeing dog because the way the last stroke for 大 is shifted rightwards would mess me up, but if the dog&#039;s got his leg up in the air... it&#039;s a nice visual image for the change from the primitive <em>graveyard</em>.).
