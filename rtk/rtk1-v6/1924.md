1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 8-6-2007(290): This is a simplification of 竝, a ideogram of <em>two</em> people <em>standing</em> in a<strong> row</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 12-1-2006(53): Hint : as a primitive I use the image of a<strong> row</strong>ing boat. In a<strong> row</strong>ing boat people sit in<strong> row</strong>s, but also side-by-side (another meaning of the kanji), working together (yet another meaning of this kanji). Note : there will also be a kanji for &quot;rowboat&quot; coming at frame 1876. The<strong> row</strong>ing boat is associated with the sport, and is a primitive, while the kanji for &quot;rowboat&quot; has a generic meaning of &quot;a small boat&quot;. In any case, the kanji for &quot;rowboat&quot; will not appear as a primitive in the book.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bkvogel">bkvogel</a>] 17-9-2008(37): Roman numeral II with 2<strong> row</strong>s of animal horns.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 18-7-2009(22): <strong>Full form:</strong> The image of a <em>viking longboat</em> has the advantage of being both a pictograph and lending to the idea of <em>rowing</em>. <strong>Flattened form:</strong> Here, we simply take the action of <em>rowing</em>, already reinforced by the previous image. <strong>Upside-down-in-a-row form:</strong> The horns on the top of this form follows the other forms as an image of a <em>Viking Berserker</em> with his horned helmet.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 14-7-2007(15): Pictograph of the standing<strong> row</strong> in a theatre. // Primitive: a<strong> row</strong> of standing penguins (since they can&#039;t sit). If it&#039;s in the top position, the penguins are in a<strong> row</strong> in a balcony above the stage. If it&#039;s in the bottom position, the penguins are in the front<strong> row</strong>, lower than the stage. If the top 3 strokes are moved to the bottom (&quot;upside down in a<strong> row</strong>&quot;), then the penguins are in a<strong> row</strong> doing headstands.
