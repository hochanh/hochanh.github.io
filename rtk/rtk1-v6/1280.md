1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 11-12-2007(170): Hustle and<strong> bustle</strong> = a big <em>St. Bernard dog</em> frisking about in a <em>haystack</em>, knocking it down and spreading the hay about, after the field hands just stacked it up.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 30-10-2006(90): A<strong> bustle</strong> is also the name for the big wire-framed skirts that women used to wear. Here&#039;s a <em>St. Bernard dog</em> jammed ass-first into the top of a <em>haystack</em>, looking like some kind of proper Victorian-era lady as he struggles to get out.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 13-3-2008(73): (note: easier way to remember haystack - it&#039;s just as difficult to find a needle in a haystack, even if you use two hands) Farmers hustling and bustling to move big haystacks.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cheechuan">cheechuan</a>] 9-3-2008(41): In the hustle and<strong> bustle</strong> of NYC, you suddenly find this humongous <em>haystack</em> and a giant <em>St. Bernard</em> sitting on top of it, howling Christmas songs. Nobody even stops to look....only in NYC.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/imagia">imagia</a>] 27-8-2008(12): - I had trouble using the haystack primitive without &quot;money&quot; as in the following frames, so I&#039;ve separated the elements out to make sure I don&#039;t put &quot;money&quot; into this kanji. Whenever you come across any<strong> BUSTLE</strong>, there&#039;s a simple solution for getting through. Get your St Bernard and prick him with a needle - he&#039;ll cut right through the<strong> BUSTLE</strong>. You just have to hold onto him with two hands!
