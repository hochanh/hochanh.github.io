1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perfecturbo">perfecturbo</a>] 28-6-2006(308): On<strong> Vessels</strong> that travel long distances, sailors often get quite lonely. They keep TURKEYS on the<strong> VESSELS</strong>, but not for use as food. The lonely sailors take turns enjoying the turkey&#039;s CROTCH.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 23-12-2007(129): Donald Duck is a <em>big bird</em> that does <em>not wear pants</em>. It&#039;s good to use him as a mnemonic because he is a sailor, and this kanji is used to count<strong> vessels</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PacifistGod">PacifistGod</a>] 30-1-2007(69): The turky&#039;s crotch is a vessel for the stuffing that you fill it with.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/peterlasky">peterlasky</a>] 7-7-2009(35): The USS Turkeycrotch is a seaworthy vessel.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 15-8-2006(16): An ole&#039; pirate <em>turkey</em> sits <em>astride</em> the prow of a vessel (i.e. with his <em>crotch</em> on the prow). Recall from PAGE 211 the old turkey with pipe and monocle : now he takes off his monocle and uses a “field-glass” to count other<strong> vessels</strong> (pirate ships) on the horizon (this kanji is also a counter for ships).
