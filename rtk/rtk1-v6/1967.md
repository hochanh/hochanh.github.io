1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 22-11-2006(134): Pictograph. I think of that Harry Potter spell book that had to be bound shut coz it wanted to eat you.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 4-3-2008(63): 冊 さつ 1: counter for books A heavy scrapbook so full that flowers are sticking out. Only if a scrapbook is that full, it can be called a heavy book.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rabite">rabite</a>] 19-7-2008(58): Pictograph of three books tied up for transport.
