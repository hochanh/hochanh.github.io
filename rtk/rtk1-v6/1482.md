For example, fetishism refers to having a fetish;<strong> mechanism</strong> here refers to having a mecha-like property, where mecha is a type of anime robot that can transform itself. Imagine a mecha that can transform itself between two forms: a huge immovable <em>tree</em> (as a form of defense) and a gigantic marching <em>abacus</em> that smashes enemies between its giant beads.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 8-1-2010(14): Uh-oh. You accidentally hit the self-destruct<strong> mechanism</strong> on your <em>abacus</em>. You hide behind a <em>tree</em> and wait for the explosion.
