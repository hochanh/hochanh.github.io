2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smujohnson">smujohnson</a>] 26-8-2008(48): To remember the order: When <strong>focusing</strong>, keep a <em>few</em> things your TOP priority, so only they come UNDER your <em>sight</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Xtophe">Xtophe</a>] 7-9-2006(41): Success (or survival?) method for accelerated juggling course: <em>focus</em> on a <em>few</em> nitroglycerine filled juggling balls flying OVER your <em>eyes</em> ---(I have trouble with this <em>few</em> primitive that can be anywhere in a kanji. To build in its location in the story is important somehow).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TerryS">TerryS</a>] 27-5-2009(22): <em>Few</em> distractions will catch your <em>eye</em> if you have<strong> FOCUS</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stehr">stehr</a>] 30-9-2007(12): <em>few</em> people can<strong> focus</strong> their <em>eyes</em> perfectly, that is 20/20, the rest of us have to wear glasses because we see out of<strong> focus</strong>.
