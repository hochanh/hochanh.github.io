1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax">Zarxrax</a>] 13-6-2008(137): I&#039;m going to<strong> visit</strong> my grandpa in the hospital. He broke his <em>elbow</em>, and it became really <em>big</em> and contorted into a weird <em>shape</em>. I hope he will be all right!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/erikkusan">erikkusan</a>] 22-3-2006(89): Whenever the postman has to pay a<strong> visit</strong> to this place, he brings an elbow-shaped thingy that he throws to the St. Bernard.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Green_Airplane">Green_Airplane</a>] 7-8-2008(43): I paid a<strong> visit</strong> to my neighbour, but I forgot he had this huge <em>St. Bernard dog</em>. The doctor said my <em>elbow</em> will never be the same <em>shape</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cbogart">cbogart</a>] 22-2-2007(33): I was a little nonplussed by the inappropriateness of this keyword, so I decided to use &quot;the three kings&quot; instead; they are a threesome, and they make a religiously-motivated<strong> visit</strong>, right? Anyway, they travel by night, so they&#039;re just these three shapes moving through the gloom. They can&#039;t see well, so a St. Bernard dog noses their elbows whenever they start to go the wrong way.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 19-3-2008(32): Hint: This is the humble/old kanji of the verb &quot;to go/to come&quot;, and also is the kanji for &quot;three&quot; on legal documents. I suggest using the &quot;three musketeers&quot; for this primitive, raising their three blades with the elbow. (the elbow primitive could be viewed as a pictograph of the musketeer&#039;s hat, with a feather on the side, too).
