1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/guidedog">guidedog</a>] 9-2-2007(224): The old<strong> west</strong> represented by a completely empty whiskey bottle (compare <a href="../v4/1427.html">sign of the bird</a> (#1427 酉) whiskey bottle about one third full).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 3-3-2008(49): Note: this kanji is also used to denote Spain.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 22-12-2008(25): The Spaghetti <strong>Western</strong> movies, typified by <em>empty bottles of whisky</em>, were so-called because it was often an Italian director that shot them. Most of these films however, were actually shot in <strong>Spain</strong> (another meaning this kanji holds).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/igordesu">igordesu</a>] 11-2-2009(21): Only <em>one</em> out of every <em>four</em><strong> west</strong>erns is worth watching. Even that&#039;s debatable. The rest are crap.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akatsukigui">akatsukigui</a>] 24-11-2010(14): <em>One</em> of the <em>four</em> directions: The<strong> West</strong>.
