1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 2-8-2006(305): Before the time of digital <strong>calculators</strong>, people used old school <strong>calculators</strong> made of <em>bamboo</em> (abacus). It&#039;s not as easy as a <strong>calculator</strong>, but you don&#039;t need any batteries either. All you need are your <em>eyes</em> and your <em>two hands</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 8-1-2006(117): Tip : you may see this as an Abacus, which is used to<strong> calculate</strong>. This particular ancient chinese Abacus has <em>eyeballs</em> in place of beads, and its frame is made of <em>bamboo</em>. You&#039;d be amazed at how fast people can<strong> calculate</strong> with this, especially if they can use <em>both hands</em> at once to move the ... <em>eyeballs</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 13-1-2007(50): Gah! I just can&#039;t<strong> calculate</strong> this differential equation! So I take a sharp bamboo pen in each hand and jam them into my eyes out of frustration.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stephan">stephan</a>] 17-11-2008(27): Warning: a different abacus will be used later as a primitive, see <a href="../v4/1381.html">how many</a> (#1381 幾).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mbaron">mbaron</a>] 18-8-2008(27): To<strong> calculate</strong> with the <em>bamboo</em> abacus, you need a sharp <em>eye</em> and <em>both hands</em>.
