1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 10-9-2007(163): You cannot pretend to<strong> translate</strong> into <em>words</em> the melody of the <em>shakuhachi</em>!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/onsen_monkey">onsen_monkey</a>] 6-9-2006(128): You all know that &#039;shakuhachi&#039; is a slang word for blowjob, right? In this kanji you got a job as a TRANSLATOR for Japanese porno movies. So you sit there all day translating dirty WORDS and watching girls perform SHAKUHACHI. This is the life!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 10-8-2008(75): Imagine some weird guy who only communicates via <em>shakuhachi</em>, so he always brings along a translator to<strong> translate</strong> his <em>shakuhachi</em> sounds into <em>words</em>. &quot;Excuse me, do you know where the library is?&quot; &quot;♫♪♫♫♪♫♪.&quot; &quot;It&#039;s just down the street on the left.&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jimsublimeman">jimsublimeman</a>] 19-10-2007(40): A true story I always think of: My friend was working as an ALT in a slightly bad Japanese high school. One day, a girl approached him in the corridor and checked nobody was watching. Saying nothing, she pointed at his crotch and then gestured to her opened mouth, smiled and promptly ran off, leaving him horrified... <em>Shakuhachi</em> in any language needs no <em>words</em> to<strong> translate</strong> I guess...

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/j0k0m0">j0k0m0</a>] 18-7-2009(26): Words R us- translating company.
