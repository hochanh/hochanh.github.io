1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977">mameha1977</a>] 17-9-2007(146): When your wife&#039;s <em>LEGs</em> get huge hairs on them it is surely a bad<strong> portent</strong> for things to come.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johanvg">johanvg</a>] 13-7-2006(110): A bad<strong> portent</strong> makes the hairs on your legs stand.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 18-12-2007(35): Two persons turning <em>their backs</em> is a bad <strong>sign</strong>. Hint: Don&#039;t use &quot;turtle&quot; as a primitive. You&#039;ll save a lot of troubles with following kanji if you give this primitive the meaning &quot;a person&#039;s back&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 27-4-2009(26): The actual derivation of this Kanji is a pictograph of the cracks on a heated <em>turtle</em> shell which was used in divination. The way the cracks occur on this <em>turtle</em> are a<strong> portent</strong> of evil bad luck.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NooNoo">NooNoo</a>] 23-4-2008(9): To me it looks like a &quot;black angel&quot; or something (four wings and its human-looking legs). Maybe seeing it is a bad<strong> portent</strong>?
