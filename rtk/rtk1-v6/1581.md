2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 25-7-2008(80): Be careful <strong>not</strong> to think woman + angel here, which has already been seen for <a href="../v4/430.html">attractive</a> (#430 嬌). Suggest using <em>woman</em> with a <em>halo</em>, as in an innocent girl, something that everyone sees their <strong>daughters</strong> as being.
