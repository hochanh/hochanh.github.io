1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 26-4-2007(280): <strong>Noh chanting</strong>?!? I meant &quot;NO CHANTING!&quot; Now all you, just shut up! Not another <em>word</em>! Don&#039;t you know that chanting can provoke attacks from the local <em>condor</em>? So, no chanting, and especially no <strong>Noh chanting</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 25-11-2008(42): Picture guy dressed in a condor mask up on stage during Noh performance chanting some words nobody understands.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 10-12-2009(12): <strong>Noh chanting</strong> is simply <em>words</em> which sound like that a <em>vulture</em> would make.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/colinsky">colinsky</a>] 21-1-2009(5): <strong>noh chanters</strong> chant their <em>words</em> in masks that look like <em>condors</em> (condor = the vulture king of the mountain.).
