5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 18-3-2012(5): My friend decided to act like superman and bust the <em>door</em> down with his<strong> shoulder</strong>. Needless to say, the end result was him crying and clutching the <em>flesh</em> of his tender<strong> shoulder</strong>.
