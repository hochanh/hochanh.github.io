1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Proxx">Proxx</a>] 23-5-2008(200): <em>Spiderman</em> wanted to be a <strong>salary</strong>man, but the suit just didn&#039;t <em>fit</em> him.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PacifistGod">PacifistGod</a>] 19-8-2008(84): Spiderman has so little free time in his schedule that he is unable to fit in a job with a good<strong> salary</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 11-7-2008(63): The quality of the <em>threads</em> one wears generally <em>fits</em> with one&#039;s<strong> salary</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 11-4-2007(45): Did you know that Spiderman gets paid by the mayor for fighting crime? The only problem is that since he doesn&#039;t have a bank account, his<strong> salary</strong> is paid out in cash. And since he doesn&#039;t carry around a wallet, he has to somehow fit the bills in his costume: a few on his back, a few on his chest, etc.
