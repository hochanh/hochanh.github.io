1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/notgoing2argue">notgoing2argue</a>] 11-3-2008(298): Men walk with their <em>elbows</em> out from their <em>sides</em> in a weird <em>turkey</em> trot when they try to appear very MASCULINE. Think of a 70&#039;s pimp walk.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 15-4-2007(94): <strong>Masculine</strong> duties are to offer your <em>elbow</em> to the lady <em>by your left side</em> and to cut the <em>turkey</em> on special meals.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 9-7-2008(80): Surely you remember <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/563">feminine/female</a> (#563 雌)? In that kanji, we said <em>stop</em>/<em>spooning</em>/<em>turkeys</em>, spoon <strong>females</strong>! Here, once again, my buddy is looking at a <em>turkey</em>. What the heck is his problem? I give him a sharp <em>elbow</em> in the <em>side</em>. &quot;Dude, be a man!&quot; I said. &quot;Where&#039;s your MASCULINE side?&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hawkeye123">Hawkeye123</a>] 19-1-2009(26): While it&#039;s not <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/563">feminine/female</a> (#563 雌) to eat a turkey with a spoon, a <strong>masculine</strong> man would push people a<em>side</em> with his <em>elbow</em> to get to the <em>turkey</em> first.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 29-4-2007(16): Imagine a turkey making a pose like it&#039;s really buff....it&#039;s elbows are by their side at an angle.
