1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep">johnzep</a>] 5-3-2007(153): The REVOLVING wheels of the car (with<strong> REVOLVE</strong>R blaring on the stereo) kicked up RISING CLOUDS of dust.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/komodo">komodo</a>] 20-6-2008(125): Just a note to remember the <em>cloud</em> primative: The name of Goku&#039;s pet <em>cloud</em> that he used to help him rise (fly) in the Dragonball anime series (and also the scientific name for a certain type of cloud) is <em>Nimbus</em> [ <a href="http://www.rpgclassics.com/shrines/gba/dbztlog/screen2.jpg">http://www.rpgclassics.com/shrines/gba/dbztlog/screen2.jpg</a> ]. The katakana-ization of this is <strong>ニム</strong>バス, so the <em>rising cloud</em> primative is just an abbreviation of that name written from top to bottom in the old Japanese style.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 24-12-2008(62): Burnout! As the car&#039;s wheels <em>revolve</em> the rubber burns making a <em>rising cloud</em> of smoke!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 10-11-2005(15): You could just think of someone smoking their tires before taking off. They&#039;re staying in one place, but the wheels of the car keep revolving round and round as a cloud of burnt rubber rise from them. To keep distinct from rotation (1046), think of rpms (revolutions per minute).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/philiphoward123">philiphoward123</a>] 16-6-2009(11): The <em>car</em>&#039;s wheels<strong> revolve</strong>, sending up a <em>rising cloud</em> of dust.
