1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977">mameha1977</a>] 27-9-2007(194): A piece of <em>metal</em> with a <em>name</em> on it. Well, this is basically the definition of<strong> inscription</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NooNoo">NooNoo</a>] 28-4-2008(35): I imagine ancient Egyptian<strong> inscription</strong>s: Pharaohs&#039; <em>names</em> written in <em>gold</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elmaestrokgb">elmaestrokgb</a>] 23-5-2009(17): The <em>gold</em> ring I gave her had an old girlfriend&#039;s <em>name</em> written inside. Here&#039;s hoping she doesn&#039;t notice the<strong> inscription</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sannomiya">sannomiya</a>] 17-4-2007(8): <strong>INSCRIPTION</strong>S are done on GOLD plaques by writing your NAME on it.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skellyfish">skellyfish</a>] 15-12-2008(7): If you&#039;ve got some METAL and you want to put a NAME on it, you&#039;ve got no choice but to use an<strong> inscription</strong> - everything else will rub off or fail to stick in the first place. (Imagine a bunch of people trying to write on metal with pencils, pens, etc. and then one guy with a Eureka moment thinking of<strong> inscription</strong>).
