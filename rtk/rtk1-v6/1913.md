4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 11-8-2006(11): In the ancient days of Buddhism, philosphers were common. Each of them would deeply ponder the meaning of <strong>nothingness</strong> while <em>reclining</em> in their <em>oaken tubs</em> of hot water. Underneath, there were <em>flames</em> to keep the water from cooling, tended by the non-philosophers. Immacolata 8-5-2006. Nothing too good for pondering the meaning of <strong>nothingness</strong>!
