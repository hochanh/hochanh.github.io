1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ivoSF">ivoSF</a>] 13-7-2006(237): <strong>Floating</strong> rubber ducky!!!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(99): A nest of fledglings somehow fell into the water (maybe it was perched on a tree bending over the river), but they are safe for now as the nest is<strong> floating</strong>. The fledglings are enjoying the cruise but they are soon coming to a great waterfall... ( a little drama to help us remember the story).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 1-11-2007(39): An ugly duckling (<em>fledgling</em>)<strong> FLOATING</strong> in the <em>water</em>. But this one doesn&#039;t grow up into a swan - he&#039;s a <em>vulture</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 30-8-2007(30): Not too difficult. When you hear<strong> FLOATING</strong>, just think of baby ducks (FLEDGELINGS) in the WATER. Well, you&#039;re pretty sure WATER has alot to do with this Kanji.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 14-10-2009(18): <strong>The noon sun makes walking on the sand feel so warm. The sea breeze feels so soothing as it caresses my skin. And in the water, dead little fledgings are<strong> floating</strong>. How nice. (and btw, that was sarcasm you dumb douchebags that flagged this!! if you flag, you=DOUCHE OF THE YEAR!!!!)</strong>.
