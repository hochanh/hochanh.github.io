5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zanzibar">zanzibar</a>] 10-6-2009(9): People use the phrase &quot;I&#039;m starving&quot; too casually. They just want some FOOD, and their EGO causes them to magnify their terminology for effect. If they were really to<strong> starve</strong>, they&#039;d lose their EGOs, and absolutely anything would become FOOD.
