1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pjhoover">pjhoover</a>] 6-11-2008(143): A person with a big mouth wants to be the<strong> center</strong> of attention.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3">thegeezer3</a>] 30-8-2007(122): Youve got the st bernard dead centre in your sights (the box).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 7-12-2006(13): You must get the explosive into the <strong>center</strong>. The armor will protect him otherwise. The key is to wait for the <em>mouth</em> of the <em>St. Bernard</em> to be open, and then fling the dynamite into the <strong>center</strong> of it.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 19-12-2007(11): For the primitive, I&#039;ll try a <em>big</em> boxy <em>target</em> - like the kind you use to line up your enemy in a videogame before you blow it up.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 20-7-2010(9): I see this as a modern-day pictogram for someone walking in carrying a big birthday cake, with one fat candle at its <strong>CENTRE</strong> (to remind me that the <strong>CENTRE</strong> vertical juts up from the &quot;cake&quot;), and to be placed at the <strong>CENTRE</strong> of a table, in honor of the person who&#039;s the day&#039;s <strong>CENTRE</strong> of attention. (I use the <strong>CENTRE</strong> instead of<strong> CENTER</strong> to promote the connection with <a href="../v4/1741.html">England</a> (#1741 英), 英 .).
