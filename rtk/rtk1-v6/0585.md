1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 31-8-2007(305): Imagine a<strong> hot water</strong> kettle for your tea, except this one is a pink piggy bank that pours the water from its snout (and squeals when the water is piping hot). Make sure to use a potholder!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Clint">Clint</a>] 13-7-2008(33): <strong>Hot water</strong> is a phrase that can mean &quot;getting into trouble.&quot; This kanji pictures just one of the many meanings of that phrase: it&#039;s <em>water</em> that you get into (with creditors and the like) when your <em>piggy bank</em> is empty!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 4-2-2008(32): My<strong> HOT WATER</strong> cut off because I forgot to pay the bill. So I break open my <em>piggy bank</em> and run to the local 銭湯 (sentou; public bath).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethg">sethg</a>] 26-2-2009(17): <strong>Hot water</strong> is the kind of <em>water</em> you don&#039;t have when your <em>piggy bank</em> is empty.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Savara">Savara</a>] 13-4-2008(13): If you put your <em>piggy bank</em> in <strong>hot <em>water</em></strong> you will make sure no one can get to it... ... including yourself.
