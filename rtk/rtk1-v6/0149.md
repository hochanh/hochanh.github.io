1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 28-11-2008(71): I couldn&#039;t find any reference to this kanji as meaning<strong> cleanse</strong>. It seems to be most often used in the following compound 沙汰 （さた）to mean affair. The other meanings seem to be closer to &#039;select&#039; so maybe Heisig meant<strong> cleanse</strong> in the ethnic sense here.. I&#039;m going to use the keyword &quot;selection&quot;, as in natural selection. Story: natural selection first began in the water, and those that were too plump were selected out.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 24-7-2009(27): <em>Water</em> is used to<strong> cleanse</strong> a <em>plump</em> man&#039;s colon.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brendanmacdonald">brendanmacdonald</a>] 29-9-2008(13): If you are FAT, it takes more WATER to<strong> CLEANSE</strong> you.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu">nolusu</a>] 27-4-2008(6): The <a href="../v4/120.html">plump</a> (#120 太) goes one a <strong>cleansing</strong> diet to restore his health. Each day he drinks his 3l of <em>water</em>, swim half a hour in <em>water</em>...

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 5-8-2009(4): The very plump man selected the Japanese toilet seat which will<strong> cleanse</strong> him with water automatically since he&#039;s too fat to reach back and wipe... (consider herman&#039;s explanation and think of &quot;selection&quot;).
