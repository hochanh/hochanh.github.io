1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 6-8-2007(106): What is a<strong> RHYME</strong> but some SOUND that EMPLOYEES say to get them through work.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matt_jenkins">matt_jenkins</a>] 24-3-2008(87): Dr Seuss&#039;s <em>employee</em> finally rebels against him: &quot;I&#039;m tired of odd <em>sounds</em> all the time, I will not, cannot, speak in<strong> RHYME</strong>!&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alunalun">Alunalun</a>] 4-7-2009(56): A<strong> rhyme</strong> is the <em>sound</em> of an <em>employee</em> going off to work. Everyone knows that ever since &#039;Snow White&#039; in 1937 all employees sing &#039;hi ho, hi ho, it&#039;s off to work I go&#039; (because it&#039;s so catchy! And it&#039;s so catchy because &#039;ho&#039;<strong> rhyme</strong>s with &#039;go&#039;!).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 2-7-2006(40): &quot;<em>Sound</em> as a pound&quot; is a<strong> rhyme</strong> that fits the kanji. <em>Sound</em> + pound. Pounds being what you make when you&#039;re an <em>employee</em> (living in the UK that is).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 12-1-2006(34): Employees of The Ministry of Sound are paid to<strong> rhyme</strong> every day.
