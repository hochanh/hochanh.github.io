1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 28-2-2007(214): Japanese &quot;<strong>gardens</strong>&quot; aren&#039;t anything more than a pot of <em>flowers</em> on top of the <em>mailbox</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/desmidus">desmidus</a>] 8-6-2008(90): My mailbox is actually right in the middle of my<strong> garden</strong>, which kind of sucks since the mailman has to trample all my flowers to get to it.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nilfisq">nilfisq</a>] 1-11-2007(14): (cf akrodha) The mailman has to be careful when delivering Hyacinth Bouquet&#039;s post. Her <em>mailbox</em> is in her<strong> garden</strong>, surrounded by fragile <em>flowers</em>. If he were to step on even one of those, he&#039;d be in major trouble...

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 20-7-2009(11): It is common to see a tiny<strong> garden</strong> of <em>flowers</em> surrounding a<em>mailbox</em>.
