1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 22-5-2008(242): My<strong> nickname</strong> is &quot;No Lips&quot;. Yep, I shouldn&#039;t have put my <em>mouth</em> on that <em>bear trap</em>...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tony563">tony563</a>] 7-5-2006(68): When certain<strong> nickname</strong> snares to people&#039;s mouths, they will call you that way forever.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 8-5-2007(44): Also used in code, signal, password, etc. A <strong>password</strong> is the <strong>code</strong> you must <em>mouthe</em> to release the <em>snare</em> so you may enter safely. Most people just use their<strong> nickname</strong> (which is not recommended by security experts).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 9-4-2009(40): Her <em>mouth</em> was a <em>snare</em> for cocks, so we gave her the<strong> nickname</strong> BJ Maxx.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 17-6-2009(27): This guy talks too damn much! We <strong>nicknamed</strong> him <em>snare-mouth</em>. Once you get into a conversation with him, you&#039;re like a small animal who wants to escape but can&#039;t!
