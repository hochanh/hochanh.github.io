2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pulse">Pulse</a>] 18-3-2012(165): <strong>Hint:</strong> <em>Here&#039;s info from Wikipedia regarding why this kanji exists, which helped me remember it:</em> [Japan also divides the month roughly into three 10-day periods. Each is called a jun ( 旬 ). The first is jōjun ( 上旬 ); the second, chūjun ( 中旬 ); the last, gejun ( 下旬 ). These are frequently used to indicate approximate times, for example, &quot;the temperatures are typical of the jōjun of April&quot;; &quot;a vote on a bill is expected during the gejun of this month.&quot;].
