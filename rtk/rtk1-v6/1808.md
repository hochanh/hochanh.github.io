4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 3-4-2010(33): (from Raichu) The classic<strong> meritorious deed</strong> is saving a damsel in distress from a burning building. You hear her sweet voice crying &quot;help! help!&quot; from inside. But when you get inside, you see that she&#039;s quite heavy... you&#039;ll need some muscles for this deed.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 21-1-2007(9): You get a medal if you do some <strong>meritorious deed</strong> in combat. When the shooting starts, some freeze and cannot <em>move</em>. The normal ones can move under <em>fire</em>. But the REAL medal winners are the ones that move over <em>flames</em>!. Not that is a <strong>meritorious deed</strong>!
