1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 2-1-2007(216): This is mostly used in the word 循環 , &quot;circulation&quot; (of buses through their routes, of blood, etc). So I think of a column of little Roman soldiers with their shields marching<strong> sequential</strong>ly through the veins of a person, as an anthropomorphization of the immune system.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 20-4-2007(61): A <em>column</em> of <em>shielded</em> soldiers advancing<strong> sequential</strong>ly to avoid revealing the size of their army (Think &quot;Sandpeople always ride single file to hide their numbers&quot; from Star Wars).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 23-4-2007(15): <em>Flash</em> can defeat the protection of the <em>shield</em>. The <em>ten</em> <em>eyes</em> open momentarily, but one after the other. He can blind them in a <strong>sequential</strong> fashion, and then attack an effectively blind opponent who cannot then <em>drag</em> the shield to meet the attack.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 10-2-2010(14): An army&#039;s <em>column</em> of marching <em>sheilds</em>, are lined up in<strong> sequential</strong> order.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TheSlakey">TheSlakey</a>] 4-1-2009(12): The adventurers go in<strong> sequential</strong> order, with the shield bearing warrior in front to shield the other party members.
