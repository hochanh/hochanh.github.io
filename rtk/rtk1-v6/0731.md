1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 27-7-2009(67): The <em>king</em> used <em>both hands</em> to<strong> tinker with</strong> himself in his spare time.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 12-6-2007(20): Picture the king holding a large pan in his two hands and tinkering with it, wishing he could lead the itinerant life of a tinker. As a rhyme: The <em>king</em>, he uses his <em>two hands</em>, To<strong> tinker with</strong> his pots and pans . . .

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama">MeisterLlama</a>] 9-11-2009(15): Tinker seems to imply mending or working at something, which is wrong. This is more like &quot;to trifle with&quot;. (The meaning of &quot;to trifle with&quot; is sufficiently different from &quot;trifle&quot; that there should be no confusion). The king can trifle with anything using his two hands (be it objects, his subjects, or himself).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 21-11-2008(7): When something new is invented, the king is always the first to be able to<strong> tinker with</strong> it. So picture yourself looking up at the <em>king</em> with <em>both hands</em> holding your new invention, only to have it <strong>tinkered with</strong> and broken by the king who would say nothing more than &quot;oh dear&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 10-4-2007(5): The <em>king</em> wore jewels on <em>both hands</em> that had been <strong>tinkered with</strong> so that they contained poison.
