1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 1-12-2008(246): History of the first karate blackbelts: In those days, it was often difficult to find fresh, clean <em>water</em>, so samurai usually had to wash their <em>sashes</em> in <strong>stagnant</strong> puddles. The longer one had been studying martial arts, the older the sash on one&#039;s karate uniform and, therefore, the darker the color. So why weren&#039;t their karate uniforms black too? Never seen a ninja????

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jwy2k2">jwy2k2</a>] 20-3-2007(72): A moat is a<strong> stagnate</strong> ring of water like an obi (sash) of water tied around the castle.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stringy_cow">stringy_cow</a>] 1-1-2009(46): WATER that is &quot;tied up&quot; as if with a SASH and unable to flow properly will become<strong> stagnate</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomtosh">tomtosh</a>] 20-12-2007(46): This is one I keep missing, and always because of the right-hand side. I can easily associate<strong> stagnate</strong> with <em>water</em> but never with <em>sash.</em> And so I will now try to associate<strong> stagnate</strong> with something around the house that often<strong> stagnate</strong>s and smells awful: the kitchen <em>washrag</em>. From washrag, I will make the association with <em>sash</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nesert">nesert</a>] 14-10-2009(41): The <em>water</em> became<strong> stagnate</strong> because the drain was clogged with a <em>sash</em>.
