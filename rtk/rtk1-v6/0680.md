1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Gaignun">Gaignun</a>] 29-3-2011(24): When sitting through laser eye surgery, the surgeon <em>stretches</em> open your <em>eye</em> with a tight-fitting <em>tool</em>. The thought of a laser cutting through the lens of your eye within moments, and possibly blinding you in the case of a mishap, makes for a very<strong> disquieting</strong> <em>state of mind</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 5-7-2010(22): <strong>Disquiet</strong>: The feeling <em>Data</em> gets when they bring out the <em>eye-stretching</em> tool to try to give him emotions by forcing him to watch disturbing movies (like they did to Alex in A Clockwork Orange).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 8-12-2009(13): <strong>dread</strong>: Dread is the state of mind when you see the odd tool made of stretched human eyes.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hissatsu">hissatsu</a>] 24-12-2010(9): What is all that racket!? My <em>state of mind</em> is <strong>disquieted</strong> by <em>extended tool</em> use!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/melchan">melchan</a>] 16-12-2011(5): <strong>Disquieting</strong> is the <em>state of mind</em> you get after seeing a table full of <em>tools</em> with little eyes staring at you.
