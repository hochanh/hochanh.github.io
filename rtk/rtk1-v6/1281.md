1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stefanot">stefanot</a>] 6-5-2007(232): History of Pompei: An unexpect<strong> erupt</strong>ion and from the <em>mouths</em> of the volcano come lava that threatens the farmers collecting <em>haystacks</em> in the fields and the fisherman catching <em>shells</em> on the coast.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomtosh">tomtosh</a>] 20-12-2007(66): A bit nasty (but makes the whole thing much easier to remember) is to take the right side and call it a <em>bearded clam.</em> For<strong> erupt</strong>, you can make your own story about the <em>mouth/opening</em> on the left.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 17-6-2006(37): Well, the local farmers stuffed the <em>mouth</em> of the dangerous volcano with <em>haystacks</em>, thinking that would prevent<strong> erupt</strong>ions. Even more stupid was one tourist who threw some sea food (<em>shellfish</em>) into the <em>mouth</em> of the volcano. This caused an instant<strong> erupt</strong>ion of unprecedented magnitude!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 3-10-2007(24): After eating some particularly bad <em>clams</em> at a dodgy seafood restaurant, you<strong> erupt</strong> and release them back out through your <em>mouth</em>. You cover up the mess with a <em>haystack</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 1-2-2010(21): For <em>30 clams</em>, a prostitute will let you<strong> erupt</strong> in her <em>mouth</em>.....LOL...
