1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 6-3-2010(218): &quot;Walking legs&quot; over &quot;bushes&quot; needs to have a primitive meaning of its own. It appears in several kanji, such as 縫 <a href="../v4/1563.html">sew</a> (#1563 縫), 逢 <a href="../v4/2417.html">tryst</a> (#2417 逢), 蜂 <a href="../v4/2687.html">bee</a> (#2687 蜂), and 鋒 <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/2768">sword's point</a> (#2768 鋒), and it is clumsy to work bushes and walking legs into every story. &quot;Pointy&quot; works fairly well: the walking legs are stuck on top of the pointy part of the bush; and for this character: a <strong>summit</strong> is the <em>pointy</em> end of a <em>mountain</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 17-4-2008(72): Moses climbs to the<strong> summit</strong> of the mountain using his walking legs to talk to the burning bush.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crayonmaster">crayonmaster</a>] 17-5-2009(57): If you are using the &quot;walking legs + bushes = pubic hair&quot; primitive... The nudist colony was banished to the top of the mountain&#039;s<strong> summit</strong>, so that nobody would have to see their bushes again!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 3-1-2007(27): Like in the next frame, the right side element is &quot;walking through bushes&quot;. This time they&#039;re not on the road, but on a mountain, whose<strong> summit</strong> you&#039;re trying to reach. (the element will come in at least 逢 again).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 16-8-2009(16): <em>Bush</em> between <em>walking legs</em> = <em>pubic hair</em>!
