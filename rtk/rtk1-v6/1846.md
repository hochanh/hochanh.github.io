1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 29-3-2007(187): Start with a <em>circumference</em> and<strong> carve</strong> away until you get the <em>shape</em> you want.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 18-12-2006(74): [My primitive for <em>shape</em> is Mystique, the shape-shifter from X-Men.] <em>Mystique</em> the shape-shifter<strong> carve</strong>s obscure markings around the <em>circumfrence</em> of her blue body.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 20-7-2008(65): (Primitive: <em>shape</em> - when you were three you played with <em>Play-Doh</em>.) 彫 : Did anyone else use the <em>circumference</em> of the <em>Play-Doh</em> container to<strong> carve</strong> circular <em>shapes</em>?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 25-4-2010(38): HINT: There are a lot of good stories on this website using Bruce Lee as a primitive for <a href="../v4/2008.html">sign of the dragon</a> (#2008 辰), so you may want to avoid using him for shape. Mystique works well, as suggested by ayoung24.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Uncreativity">Uncreativity</a>] 28-1-2010(15): HINT: To help me remember that 彡 leans the opposite way as ミ, I am calling that primitive <em>my evil twin</em>. It&#039;s <em>mi</em> from the mirror universe. You can also think of it as the three strokes of my evil twin&#039;s goatee. STORY: I know the witness saw me<strong> carve</strong> the entire <em>circumference</em> of the victim&#039;s skin, but it wasn&#039;t me, officer; it was <em>my evil twin</em>.
