1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3">thegeezer3</a>] 1-7-2007(206): Damn racoons ill show them. I put a snare in the<strong> bin</strong> as well as a few phosphorous sparklers so as to scare the shit out of the buggers as they rummage through my<strong> bin</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smujohnson">smujohnson</a>] 2-3-2009(135): (thegeezer3) Damn racoons... I&#039;ll show them. I&#039;ll put a SNARE in the<strong> BIN</strong> as well as a few SPARKLERS so as to scare the shit out of the buggers, then hit them with a SHOVEL.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 12-6-2007(40): A typical German apartment has five different kind of trash<strong> bin</strong>s: paper, plastic, glass, biodegradable, and everything else. Don&#039;t you dare throw your trash in the wrong<strong> bin</strong>, or else you&#039;ll find yourself on the wrong side of a booby trap: hung by a <em>snare</em>, burned by <em>sparklers</em>, and knocked out cold by a <em>shovel</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 24-12-2006(25): (Reformatted from erikkusan) The Windows Recycle<strong> Bin</strong> is like a <em>snare</em> holding onto your trash. When you empty it, a window displays little <em>sparkles</em> as the files are <em>shoveled</em> off of your hard drive.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 2-1-2007(14): This is alternative way of writing 箱 , used in e.g. 函館 (はこだて) and sometimes as is. This<strong> bin</strong> is actually a snare with a powerful sparkler in it that kills rats that enter it, the remains of which are then shoveled away (to a &quot;recycle<strong> bin</strong>&quot; perhaps).
