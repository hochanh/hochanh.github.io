3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/indigo360">indigo360</a>] 22-7-2008(77): I know this, but I am an idiot and forgot.... The way I remember this is to think of the way in which Japanese people point to themselves if they are unsure of who is being spoken to. In the west, we usually say, &quot;me?&quot; and point to ourselves (pointing to the chest), but in Japan, people say, &quot;ore/boku/atashi?&quot; and point directly at their nose, the drop between their eyes. True story.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kiisu">kiisu</a>] 22-1-2008(26): Me, myself and eye.
