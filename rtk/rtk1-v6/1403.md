This<strong> regiment</strong> is called &quot;<em>Horned Pig</em><strong> Regiment</strong>&quot;. They&#039;re wearing Wiking helms and are usually cowered in mud.

Well, just the elements and shape give it away. The very lurid details that don’t need to be mentioned are always involved with<strong> REGIMENT</strong>S. They work very hard to get to the Pinnacle to get the high land and on the way, they act as though they are just Horny Piggies that rape and take away everything.
