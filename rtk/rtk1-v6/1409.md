1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nuriko">Nuriko</a>] 5-3-2008(113): <em>The Pinnacle</em>, to me, is a city that makes itself out to be perfect but is filled with dirty secrets that photographers are always trying to reveal (see <a href="../v4/1044.html">dissolve</a> (#1044 融) The city&#039;s councilmen have<strong> isolate</strong>d all professional photographers to make sure they don&#039;t photograph these &quot;dirty secrets&quot;. (which are up to your imagination).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stehr">stehr</a>] 24-10-2007(97): The people of the <em>pinnacle</em><strong> isolate</strong> themselves, <em>dissolving</em> any outside friendships.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/playadom">playadom</a>] 20-6-2008(77): Sadly, since the Pinnacle is<strong> isolate</strong>d, they have no modern technology. Their only means of photography is an old camera. What&#039;s that? Forgot how old cameras work? Let me show you: Light is captured through the lens (one mouth), the photographer is in a giant hood, all you can see out of it are his human legs. He holds his flash controller(a spike) in hand.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shimouma">shimouma</a>] 23-6-2008(21): Imagine the landscape photographer, like Ansel Adams,<strong> isolate</strong>d and alone at the pinancle taking pictures with his camera. (See zenkun&#039;s story for (FRAME 1044) dissolve).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 6-10-2009(18): Do you remember the poor insect in <a href="../v4/1044.html">dissolve</a> (#1044 融)? Actually, it was not dissolved - it was beamed right into the <em>pinnacle</em> prison for committing the crime of disturbing a <em>photographer preparing for a snapshot</em> and now lives<strong> isolate</strong>d until the end of its three days long life... (note: 隔てる (へだてる) also means to <strong>disturb ones view</strong>).
