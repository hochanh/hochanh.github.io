1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wazzab">wazzab</a>] 10-3-2007(133): You awaken from your <em>siesta</em> because you feel extremely <strong>thirst</strong>y so you go looking for some <em>water</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/onsen_monkey">onsen_monkey</a>] 23-9-2006(72): The muchacho taking his SIESTA cries out that he is<strong> THIRST</strong>Y. So you pull out a bottle of WATER and pretend you&#039;re going to give it to him...but then you dump it all on the ground before his eyes. HAHA, sucked in muchacho!!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Istvan">Istvan</a>] 13-6-2007(36): This whole series is easy to me if you picture Cheech as the man taking the Siesta. &quot;He man, you gotta drinka water man? I am like so<strong> thirst</strong>y I could die man.&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibilchan">chibilchan</a>] 1-9-2009(22): If anyone is having difficulty creating stories with the primitive <em>siesta</em>, try changing it to <em>beggar</em> - a <em>beggar</em> sits in his box begging for food/money under a hot sun. I have used <em>beggar</em> as a primitive in several frames and it works like a charm. Here a <em>beggar</em> develops a deep<strong> thirst</strong> for <em>water</em> as he crouches in his box under the hot sun.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Bullwhip">Bullwhip</a>] 5-6-2008(18): Have some <em>water</em> before you take a <em>siesta</em>, or you will wake up<strong> thirst</strong>y!
