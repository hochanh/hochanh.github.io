1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 15-4-2007(308): This guy has an<strong> attitude</strong> problem – lots of <em>ability</em>, but his <em>heart</em>&#039;s not in it.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/redskatz">redskatz</a>] 9-4-2009(113): Having a good <strong>attitude</strong> means believing in your <em>heart</em> that you have the <em>ability</em> to do anything - like memorizing more than 2000 kanji, for example.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 16-10-2006(13): If you had the <em>ability</em> to read people&#039;s <em>hearts</em> (especially women&#039;s hearts), it&#039;d be so easy to find out why they have such an<strong> attitude</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/morganandrew">morganandrew</a>] 12-4-2010(11): &quot;It&#039;s an<strong> attitude</strong> problem I&#039;m afraid,&quot; says the teacher at parents&#039; evening. &quot;He has the ABILITY to be a great but his HEART is not in it.&quot; &quot;What should we do?&quot; says the concerned parent. &quot;Let&#039;s try this HEART, shall we?&quot; says the coach, handing over a HEART that will give their child a better<strong> attitude</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 1-4-2008(8): Hint: Carebears (trading fire for heart-power).
