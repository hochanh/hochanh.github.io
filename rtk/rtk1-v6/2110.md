1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samueruht">samueruht</a>] 15-2-2008(215): A legend says that if you<strong> model</strong> a <em>mountain goat</em> (with tail and everything) from dirt and leave to the light of the moon on the <a href="../v4/2846.html">first day of the month</a> (#2846 朔), the <em>dirt</em> will became <em>flesh</em>. (blackstockc).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blackstockc">blackstockc</a>] 28-1-2008(74): If you<strong> model</strong> a mountain goat from &quot;soil&quot; and leave it under the full &quot;moon,&quot; it will come to life.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 15-6-2007(36): Think of a Chia Pet. One of the very first<strong> model</strong>s was a <em>mountain goat made entirely of soil</em>, but it wasn&#039;t stable at all. The soil would crack and dry up in sunlight, so the only way to give a soil-based Chia Pet some light was to leave it in the <em>soft glow of the full moon</em>. They were spectacular, but the clay<strong> model</strong>s soon proved to be easier to sell.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 22-11-2007(35): Tip: <em>mountain goat</em> and <em>moon</em> are later combined into <a href="../v4/2846.html">first day of the month</a> (#2846 朔).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 26-12-2008(9): The <em>mountain goat</em>, who has the cow as its role<strong> model</strong>, also tried to jump over the <em>moon</em>. Unfortunately it couldn&#039;t even lift itself off the <em>ground</em>.
