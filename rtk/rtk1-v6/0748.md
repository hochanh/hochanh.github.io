1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 5-10-2006(325): <em>One</em><strong> officer</strong> can change the course of <em>history</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mhheie">mhheie</a>] 24-3-2008(95): <em>One</em><strong> officer</strong>, namely Napoleon, changed the course of <em>history</em>. (Thanks, ayoung24). Napoleon is also my primitive meaning.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 1-7-2007(37): In a police state, the police<strong> officer</strong>s all speak with <em>one mouth</em> and have a gun tucked <em>under their arm</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 3-7-2011(26): This is not <a href="../v4/1095.html">military officer</a> (#1095 尉), but more of a government<strong> officer</strong>, official or bureaucrat, such as Barack Obama, who started out as a lowly government<strong> officer</strong> (communitee organizer) and the broke through the glass <em>ceiling</em> to become president of the United States and make <em>history</em> (I know a glass ceiling generally refers to an obstacle for women, but I wanted to avoid key words such as <a href="../v4/98.html">woman</a> (#98 女), <a href="../v4/1151.html">lady</a> (#1151 婦) or <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/563">feminine/female</a> (#563 雌)).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/onsen_monkey">onsen_monkey</a>] 3-10-2006(20): I used HISTORY as a primitive rather than separating it into &#039;mouth&#039; and &#039;tucked under the arm&#039;. Think about the Japanese history textbook controversy. The government<strong> OFFICER</strong>S choosing the textbooks are the ONE elite group determining Japan&#039;s HISTORY.
