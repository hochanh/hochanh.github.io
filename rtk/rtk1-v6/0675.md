1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 9-11-2007(345): At the <em>meeting of butchers</em>, in their narrow <em>state of mind</em>, they throw lame jokes around like, &#039;Oh hello, it&#039;s a<strong> pleasure</strong> to <em>meat</em> you&#039;, and find this rather pleasing.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu">Kurisu</a>] 13-5-2008(77): Image : <em>Data</em> attending a <em>meeting of the butchers union</em>. As a joke to begin his speech he says, &#039;Its a <strong>pleasure</strong> to MEAT you all.&#039; (thanx to Shibo &amp; nestOr).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 20-5-2008(62): Manson? Bundy? Jack the Ripper? Whichever killer or <em>butcher</em> brings to mind the most graphic image (maybe a meeting of all of them?) - you won&#039;t forget this kanji as you peer into their deranged <em>state of mind</em>: can&#039;t you just see their vacant stares and smiles on their faces, while they takes great<strong> PLEASURE</strong> in plying their trade? Creepy.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 17-11-2005(27): A <em>meeting of butchers</em> has dissolved into an orgy of blood-squirting violence. But since the killing <em>state of mind</em> is the highest<strong> pleasure</strong> a butcher can experience, they are all smiles.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 29-11-2009(22): <strong>Pleasure</strong> is the state of mind when flesh meets flesh (especially when one flesh is sabre-like).
