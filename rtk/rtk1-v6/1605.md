1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 9-5-2007(295): I&#039;ve finally met my arch-rival, the evilest of all <em>villains</em>. Finally, I&#039;m about to fight him. But what&#039;s this? He&#039;s suspiciously quiet. I move to attack him, and his right arm falls off at the <em>elbow</em>. Strange. I walk up to him and<strong> detach</strong> his left arm. Very strange. I undo his <em>belt</em>, and take off his <em>top hat</em>... BLAST! It was just a decoy <em>turkey</em>!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/desmidus">desmidus</a>] 16-6-2008(135): The most ridiculous character ever dreamt up for a film.<strong> DETACH</strong>O, a top-hat wearing villian who is able to<strong> detach</strong> his body parts for use as weapons. His most powerful weapons are his elbows, which he can<strong> detach</strong>, tie together with his belt and use as nunchucks.<strong> DETACH</strong>O has a sidekick turkey which he uses as an advanced scout as well.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall">pmbeddall</a>] 17-1-2008(73): I&#039;m surprised no one has worked Oddjob, the <em>villain</em> from the James Bond movie, Goldfinger into their stories. He&#039;s the big oriental guy that killed people by throwing his <em>top hat</em> at them. He practises his technique on turkeys,<strong> detach</strong>ing their heads in the process. Being an assassin, he can also kill people by garroting them with his <em>belt</em> or smashing them with his <em>elbows</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 29-5-2009(32): As for the left element - 离 - i think it&#039;d be interesting to read the following wiki-article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi_">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi_</a>(mythology). This is <em>chi</em> (in this case <em>ri</em>) - mythological hornless dragon or <em>wyvern</em>. Best to remember it as a primitive, because it appears in a number of rare kanji: 禽 (2049); 璃 (2048); 檎 (2050);擒. Though Heisig defined this element as <em>sheik</em> in RTK3, this is completely arbitrary.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 1-2-2008(18): This <em>turkey</em> is a <em>top hat</em>-wearing <em>villain</em>, and he keeps his own <em>elbows</em> in his <em>belt</em>, gunslinger style, ready to<strong> detach</strong> them and throw them one after another like boomerangs when necessary.
