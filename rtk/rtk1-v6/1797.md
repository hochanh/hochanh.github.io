1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 24-9-2006(183): [True story] In Osaka the homeless (the<strong> alienate</strong>d) live in large numbers around the city <em>zoo</em>. Picture them in winter all <em>bundled</em> up in rags trying to keep warm,<strong> alienate</strong>d from the society, living literally worst than the animals in the <em>zoo</em> who at least are <em>bundled</em> in their natural furs and have pens to live in sheltered from the elements.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 10-7-2007(85): This kanji is so strange that it was<strong> alienate</strong>d at the kanji <em>zoo</em>. The <em>bundle</em> of joy stork bundles this kanji up and takes it to a kanji foster home.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 10-9-2006(49): Think of a Kanji <em>Zoo</em>, where we <em>bundle</em> up all the bizarre and hard to remember kanji, to be ridiculed and <em>alienated</em> from the other more sensible kanji. This kanji definately belongs there!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 16-5-2008(23): The cleaner at the ZOO felt<strong> ALIENATE</strong>D by everyone. Granted, he was carrying around the BUNDLE of manure he cleaned from the ZOO cages. (Just picture a zoo cleaner carrying a bundle of dung with the crowd avoiding him).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/noname">noname</a>] 20-2-2008(15): Very rarely does this kanji appear in a word meaning &quot;alienate.&quot; The better meaning is &quot;sparse,&quot; such as not dense, very few, scattered, or spread irregularly. It also appears in words that have to do with &quot;neglect.&quot; 疎ら 【まばら】 (adj-na,n) sparse; (P) STORY: at the ZOO BUNDLES of happy animals are SPARSE.
