3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 2-5-2006(45): Common scene in (old) computer rpgs. Skeletons with sabers coming at you neatly in a<strong> file</strong>. (see <a href="../v4/1288.html">skeleton</a> (#1288 骨)).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 17-4-2008(32): Really this means things/persons lined up in a <strong>row</strong> (as opposed to &#039;columns&#039;). So just picture a <strong>row</strong> of neatly lined up <em>bones</em><strong> file</strong>d next to a <strong>row</strong> of nicely lined up <em>swords.</em> Must be some sort of Khmer Rouge memorial. Now picture the people <strong>lining up</strong> outside the museum to<strong> file</strong> past those <strong>rows</strong> of <em>bones</em> and <em>swords.</em> Now you remember this kanji is good for both things and people.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mothralad">mothralad</a>] 5-3-2007(11): Imagine dead soldiers standing in<strong> file</strong> to get into afterlife: bones of severed limbs in one hand, saber in the other.
