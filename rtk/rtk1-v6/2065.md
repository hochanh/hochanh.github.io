1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/naniwa">naniwa</a>] 18-3-2007(277): This kanji is, of course, pronounced &quot;taku&quot;, and it seems the owner of this<strong> home</strong> is a little bit otaku himself. He has hung up <em>locks of hair</em> suruptitiously obtained from various females all over his <em>house</em>. A veritable hair fetishist, and certainly someone whose<strong> home</strong> you wouldn&#039;t want to visit.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Terhorst">Terhorst</a>] 13-2-2008(61): &quot;<strong>Home</strong> is where the <em>hair</em> is&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Copycatken">Copycatken</a>] 29-6-2006(43): At<strong> home</strong>, all the drains in my <em>house</em> are clogged up with <em>locks of hair</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 16-4-2008(20): I&#039;m very paranoid when I finally call my <em>house</em> a<strong> home</strong>, so whenever I leave, I cut a <em>lock of hair</em>, divide it into strands, and place it at all the entrances. If one is displaced, then I know someone has been there! Saw that in a James Bond movie.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3">thegeezer3</a>] 1-7-2007(16): House and locks of hair (goldilocks) = goldilocks broke into the bears house and treat it like her own<strong> home</strong> the selfish bitch.
