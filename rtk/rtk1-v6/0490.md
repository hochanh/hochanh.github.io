1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rhclaghorn">rhclaghorn</a>] 26-12-2007(110): Why is my package late? Imagine a UPS driver dressed in<strong> BROWN</strong> <em>garments</em> taking a <em>siesta</em>. What can<strong> BROWN</strong> do for you?

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Francois">Francois</a>] 8-4-2008(88): Mexicans use a <em>cloak</em> (pancho) for their <em>siestas</em>. Their color is usually<strong> brown</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 31-1-2007(42): The hobbits from &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; just had to crawl under their<strong> brown</strong> <em>cloaks</em> and they could take a <em>siesta</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Istvan">Istvan</a>] 13-6-2007(30): Cheech, &quot;Oh jeez, I Shit myself man! Now my clothes are all<strong> brown</strong> man...&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stevieman">Stevieman</a>] 19-3-2010(17): If you break up SIESTA into <em>tongue wagging in mouth</em>, <em>bound up</em>, <em>sitting man</em>, you have somewhat the image of a prisoner begging. This gives you the general sense of <em>BEGGAR</em>. Using <em>BEGGAR</em> as a primitive is better I think. A <a href="../v4/451.html">thirst</a> (#451 渇) beggar begs for water. A beggar speaks requesting an <a href="../v4/452.html">audience</a> (#452 謁)(to beg for money), a <em>BEGGAR&#039;S GARMENTS</em> are usually<strong> brown</strong>(dirty), and beggars sleep so much when they open their mouth, their voice is <a href="../v4/454.html">hoarse</a> (#454 喝). (btw, chinese etymology: the bottom part of siesta means to beg).
