2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 10-2-2008(191): Tip: If you are confusing this keyword,<strong> remorse</strong>, with <a href="../v4/625.html">repent</a> (#625 悔) and <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1460">regret/resentment</a> (#1460 恨), then note that<strong> rEMOrse</strong> contains EMOtion.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jamiemw">jamiemw</a>] 6-10-2007(83): <em>Data</em> feels<strong> remorse</strong> for stealing the human <em>emotion</em> chip.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 3-8-2008(38): <em>Data</em> feels<strong> remorse</strong> for stealing the human <em>emotion</em> chip. So, he takes it out. Then his<strong> remorse</strong> is gone so he puts it back in.. Then he takes it out. This could go on for a while, couldn&#039;t it? (thanks jamiemw!).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(26): This kanji shows<strong> remorse</strong> (regret) as a mind filled with emotions from the past, coming back to “bite at” one&#039;s conscience and disturb one&#039;s piece of mind.
