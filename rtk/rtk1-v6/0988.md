1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 12-4-2007(189): Parts of parts of parts of parts of rice... is <strong>flour</strong>. (Image: geishas patting their face with RICE<strong> flour</strong> to make it white. Not wheat<strong> flour</strong>...).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 9-4-2007(59): In the <em>United States</em>, <em>part</em> of every meal is made from<strong> flour</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 13-5-2008(54): In Japan, <em>rice</em><strong> flour</strong> is <em>part</em> of a balanced diet. Mmmm, mochi...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 25-11-2007(40): Only part of the rice is used to make<strong> flour</strong>. The hull and bran are discarded. I have trouble with the positioning of the primitives. Remember that &quot;rice&quot; is the main topic, and gets the strong left-hand position.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Georgi87">Georgi87</a>] 13-4-2008(14): To make sure you don&#039;t think of wheat instead of RICE for this one, just consider that wheat is a foreign substance in Japan, so naturally their<strong> flour</strong> is RICE<strong> FLOUR</strong>. Anyway, what is rice<strong> flour</strong> but rice crushed to teeny tiny little bits/parts?
