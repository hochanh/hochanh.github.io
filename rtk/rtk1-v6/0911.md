1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 17-12-2008(112): <strong>Retainer</strong>: <em>a servant, especially one who has worked for a person or familly for a long time.</em> Now, if you imagine looking at a<strong> retainer</strong> (e.g. Igor) from top, you see how he is bending his head (middle rectange) between his two shoulders as he offers something with his two hands (upper and lower lines) to his master.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yvanc">yvanc</a>] 12-6-2007(71): Its a pictograph of a teeth with a<strong> retainer</strong> in the middle.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 14-11-2007(68): <strong>Retainer</strong> = A slave (for the purposes of this kanji.) This is a pictograph of a slave collar with two handcuffs dangling from it.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 16-4-2007(23): It may be useful to know that 大臣 （だいじん） means Minister.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavin.schultz-ohkubo">gavin.schultz-ohkubo</a>] 17-5-2010(13): It&#039;s clearly an X-Wing. Piloted as usual by everyone&#039;s favourite slave /<strong> retainer</strong>, R2-D2. I&#039;ll attempt to use him as a primitive in the following kanji. (He&#039;s much easier to use as a primitive because a) he&#039;s more loveable than an X-Wing and b) he&#039;s always where the action is).
