1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Proxx">Proxx</a>] 17-11-2007(252): A <em>mysterious</em> <em>turkey</em> with human <em>finger</em>s wants to<strong> hug</strong> me... I will never go to Tokyo Disneyland again!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pupul07">pupul07</a>] 14-12-2007(62): Imagine Gandalf<strong> hug</strong>ging a turkey....ouch! It bit off his finger!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ivantolearnkanji">ivantolearnkanji</a>] 25-3-2008(33): Ok sweetheart, I want you to point your finger at the mysterious turkey who<strong> hug</strong>ged you inappropriately.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/felicitygreen">felicitygreen</a>] 18-3-2006(20): As you peer even more closely at the <em>top-hat</em> clad <em>cocoon</em> from frame 1383 you realise that it&#039;s actually ET in disguise, back on earth for Christmas (carrying a <em>turkey</em> from his home planet), and holding out a luminescent brown <em>finger</em> towards you. You leap up and give him a<strong> hug</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 13-11-2006(17): You can also break this into primitives as conjecture with mysterious stuck in the middle (I have enough finger and turkey primitives going through my head that I don&#039;t need any more...). As you<strong> hug</strong> your loved one who&#039;s going off on a mysterious mission, your conjecture is that you won&#039;t see them again.
