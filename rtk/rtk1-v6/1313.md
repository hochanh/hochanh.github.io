1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 5-10-2007(206): It is with the <em>halberd</em> he holds that the <em>taskmaster</em> exerts his <em>power</em> over those actually performing the<strong> task</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 12-5-2007(122): So many video games have a &quot;boss&quot; stage you must pass in order to advance to the next level. Here, your<strong> task</strong> is to use your <em>halberd</em> to beat the <em>taskmaster</em> with the huge, bulging <em>muscles</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 20-12-2007(31): The most <em>powerful<strong> task</strong>master</em> knows how to multi-<strong>task</strong>. Here he&#039;s given himself the impossible<strong> task</strong> of <em>halberd</em> sparring with one arm, and <em>muscle</em> building with the other - and he&#039;s succeeding!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elmaestrokgb">elmaestrokgb</a>] 28-6-2009(21): A first RPG<strong> task</strong>--not even a full quest, just a<strong> task</strong> some random dude gives you (you always have to start off with some stupid weapon and go kill some other random dude, for no reason). Here, take this <em>halberd</em> I happen to have lying around. Now go kill the <em>taskmaster</em> and his hired-<em>muscle</em> UNDERling.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 27-8-2010(14): Your<strong> task</strong> is: take the <em>halberd</em> from the huge <em>taskmaster</em> with all the bulging <em>muscles</em>.
