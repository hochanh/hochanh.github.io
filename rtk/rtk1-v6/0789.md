1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cjon256">cjon256</a>] 1-5-2009(345): The<strong> leader</strong> in this race is the <em>turtle</em>! It appears he has covered the <em>vulture</em>’s feet in <em>glue</em>, so that the vulture cannot get off the starting block.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 18-12-2007(73): X-men and TMNT join forces: Their new<strong> leader</strong> is an awsome asshole. He is simply Wolverine and Raphael glued together back to back (the biggest assholes from both groups combined).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 9-4-2007(43): Once upon a time a <em>turtle</em> managed to trick a <em>vulture</em> into <em>gluing</em> itself to the turtle&#039;s shell. This way the turtle could now fly anywhere and became the<strong> leader</strong> of the turtles.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theBryan">theBryan</a>] 25-7-2008(32): A great<strong> leader</strong> must have three things: The robustness of a turtles shell. The shrewdness of a vulture. People that will stick to him like glue and follow him anywhere.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 13-1-2011(18): A<strong> leader</strong> should possess the qualities of the <em>turtle</em> - patience and persistance - and the <em>eagle</em> - aggression and good sight. And loads of charisma, so the followers stick like <em>glue</em>. 将来 しょうらい future; 将軍 しょうぐん General.
