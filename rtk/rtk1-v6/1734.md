1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 2-5-2007(231): <em>Trees</em> were frequenly used as <strong>signposts</strong> in those days, indicating where one had to go to cast their <em>ballots</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 31-1-2007(66): Large <em>wooden</em><strong> signpost</strong>s are planted on peoples lawns, with the faces of their representatives all saying: &quot;Vote [1] Me!&quot; for the upcoming <em>ballot</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blackstockc">blackstockc</a>] 17-1-2008(38): The republicans attempted to rig the election by placing<strong> signpost</strong>s on a progression of trees saying &quot;democrat ballot boxes this way.&quot; The last sign pointed to a cliff. Very funny, guys.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 27-12-2008(18): [Warning: Not a very nice story] There&#039;s a<strong> signpost</strong> up high in the <em>tree</em> that says where the blacks can cast their <em>ballots</em>. It&#039;s so high up, they cannot read it. (In the old West, blacks were able to vote, but prevented from doing so.).
