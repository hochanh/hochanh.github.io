1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amema">amema</a>] 20-11-2007(108): The tree has reached the<strong> extremity</strong> of its growth and no longer produces small, new branches at the top. Instead the existing top branch just grows longer and longer.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 8-4-2008(30): There are no great stories for this one yet, and I always forget it.. So, let&#039;s try something ridiculous: The man lived by himself in the wilderness, with no females within miles. So, his only way of relief was to stick his<strong> extremity</strong> into a small hole in a <em>tree</em>.. The poor guy. Which horizontal stroke is the<strong> extremity</strong>? The longer one or the shorter one? That, my friends, is up to your own imaginations. I&#039;d prefer not to dwell on that point, myself. ;).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dualta">Dualta</a>] 13-3-2008(29): The <strong>tree&#039;s</strong> top branches have grown to <strong>extremities</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NyahK">NyahK</a>] 3-12-2009(23): Another version of that by mameha1977 and dat5h: [Cheat] Remember these as a set: The <em>tree</em> ( 木 ) has <em>not yet</em> ( 未 ) reached the<strong> extremity</strong> ( 末 ) of its <em>vermilion</em> ( 朱 ) foliage.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/arthur">arthur</a>] 18-1-2009(9): It&#039;s near the upper<strong> extremity</strong> of the tree that grows the larger branches.
