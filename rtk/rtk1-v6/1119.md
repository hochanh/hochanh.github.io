1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Crowfoot">Crowfoot</a>] 30-4-2008(74): You<strong> cover over</strong> the <em>shredder</em> with <em>flowers</em> when the FBI comes a-knockin&#039;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 29-7-2008(21): <em>Shredder</em> is writing a anonymous ransom note to the police. &quot;Bring me one billion dollars or I&#039;ll destroy your city with my Foot Soldiers! Signed, <em>Shredder</em>.&quot; ...oops! This was supposed to be anonymous, but he signed his own name! He can&#039;t re-write it now, he spent all that time doing the letter in beautiful calligraphy. What to do? ...Thinking fast, <em>Shredder</em> grabs a large <em>daisy</em> and some tape, and <strong>covers over</strong> his name, leaving only the &quot;-er.&quot; Good thinking, <em>Shredder</em>!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 24-7-2009(14): The <em>taskmaster</em> arranges <em>flowers</em> to<strong> cover over</strong> the <em>rags</em> she makes us clean with.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/enryu">enryu</a>] 27-8-2009(10): See why the FLOWERS keep on falling into the SHREDDER? You keep on forgetting to put the<strong> COVER OVER</strong> it. After you finished with it dont forget to put the<strong> COVER over</strong> it so that the FLOWERS wont fall into it again.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum">oregum</a>] 26-11-2011(6): SHREDDER COVERED OVER himself with FLOWERS so that the TMNT would not find him.
