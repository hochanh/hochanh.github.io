1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977">mameha1977</a>] 10-7-2007(174): That stone has sparks coming out of it! Someone must have poured<strong> nitrate</strong> acid on it.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Xtophe">Xtophe</a>] 18-9-2006(74): Salpetre is the common name for<strong> Nitrate</strong> coming from Latin &quot;sal petrae&quot; or <em>stone</em> salt. It is also a component of gun powder so including a <em>candle</em> in this kanji can be quite explosive!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nurupo">nurupo</a>] 24-4-2008(41): People I study Kanji with kept talking about some<strong> nitrate</strong>. I didn&#039;t even know what<strong> nitrate</strong> is, so I hit them with a stone so hard there were sparks flying everywhere. Months later my cell-mate in jail told me it&#039;s some sort of acid, but I didn&#039;t care any more... Thanks to this Kanji I got 30 years, thank you.
