1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 26-4-2007(273): <strong>Bruce Lee</strong> is such a badass he climbed a sheer vertical <em>cliff</em> using only <em>2 hairpins</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Green_Airplane">Green_Airplane</a>] 6-3-2010(39): The kid said &quot;I don&#039;t believe you! Dragons don&#039;t exist!&quot; so we made a little surprise for him: we pinned a huge <strong>dragon </strong> (it was just a <strong>sign</strong> really) on a nearby <em>cliff</em>. &quot;Whoaaa! Dragon!&quot; the kid said. &quot;But why won&#039;t it move?&quot; &quot;I tell you why, cause it&#039;s pinned there with <em>two hairpins</em>&quot; I thought to myself.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 14-1-2006(31): As a primitive I use the image of <em>Bruce Lee</em> .

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 20-3-2009(20): This is the image(sign) of a dragon carved into a <strong>cliff</strong> face. However, the dragon has no eyes. Legend has it that there are <strong>two</strong> magical <strong>hairpins</strong> that can be inserted into the eye sockets to make the dragon come to life.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tryllid">tryllid</a>] 29-12-2008(11): Cliff + two + Hairpins: The<strong> sign of the dragon</strong> was carved into the <em>cliff</em> face with <em>two hairpins</em> that were abandoned in the sand below.
