1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 1-1-2007(267): Hooks with small wings attached look like hummingbirds with a long beak. Two hummingbirds are trying to<strong> fly</strong> away with our little measuring box. What do they want it for?

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joxn_costello">joxn_costello</a>] 5-2-2009(36): Two <em>hummingbirds</em><strong> fly</strong>ing to feed at a <em>measuring box</em> filled with sugar water. <strong>This kanji is famous for having hard-to-remember stroke order. </strong> Try it this way: first a <em>hummingbird</em> <strong>flies</strong> over the <em>measuring box walls backwards</em>. But finally the other <em>hummingbird</em> manages to stick its beak right through them.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 17-7-2007(26): Captain <em>hook</em><strong> fly</strong>ing in a <em>measuring</em> box with two <em>propellers</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 6-8-2009(19): (To keep the stroke order)<strong> Fly</strong>ing by, you see a <em>hummingbird</em> land on a <em>walking stick</em>. The bird looks around and sees a <em>person</em> nearby bending over, and gives the signal to attack. In swoops a second <em>hummingbird</em>, poking it&#039;s beak right into his back. Ouch!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ktcgx">ktcgx</a>] 3-12-2012(8): I learnt this Kanji a long time ago, when I was a kid, and the image I had for it is so vivid it&#039;s served me well, and I thought I&#039;d share it. This Kanji is <em>two hummingbirds</em><strong> fly</strong>ing over a field of <em>asparagus stalks</em>. But one flew too low, and got its beak stuck through two stalks.
