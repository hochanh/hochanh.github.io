1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 18-9-2007(184): Water each flower or the petals will wither and<strong> fall</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pm215">pm215</a>] 15-2-2008(120): [It&#039;s been suggested on the forum (<a href="http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=1079">http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=1079</a>) that <em>flower</em> across the full width of the kanji and <em>water</em> on the left below it should have its own keyword; <em>seaweed</em> is a popular choice. See also <a href="../v4/227.html">dilute</a> (#227 薄), <a href="../v4/1912.html">clan</a> (#1912 藩), <a href="../v4/2035.html">seaweed</a> (#2035 藻). This story is for the benefit of those using that idea.] Picture a group of Japanese skydivers <strong>fall</strong>ing through the sky -- suddenly <em>each</em> one opens, instead of a parachute, an enormous sheet of nori <em>seaweed</em> to carry them safely down.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yasser">Yasser</a>] 20-11-2008(75): &quot;Flowers&quot; need &quot;water&quot; &quot;each&quot; day or they&#039;ll bend and<strong> fall</strong> over (helps with the order of writing).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/notgoing2argue">notgoing2argue</a>] 9-4-2007(25): The <em>flowers</em><strong> FALL</strong> over the <em>water each</em> hanami season.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 12-11-2008(13): &quot;each&quot; is impossible to visualize, instead I picture a guy<strong> fall</strong>ing down with his mouth open in a scream and his walking legs above him flailing as he&#039;s<strong> fall</strong>ing. Works well for this kanji if you imagine him<strong> fall</strong>ing from a waterfall. At first he&#039;s holding on to some flowers, but they finally give and he tumbles into the water below.
