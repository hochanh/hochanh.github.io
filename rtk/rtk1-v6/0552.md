1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 6-4-2008(206): In Japanese this is KEN, as in Barbie&#039;s boyfriend. He has lovely blue <em>eyes,</em> a girlfriend who is as thin as a <em>straightened out fish hook</em>. But, down where it counts, he has very <em>little</em> to show...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 9-1-2007(177): After sticking a <em>fishhook</em> in your <em>eye</em>, the yakuza boss probably has <em>little</em> more to do to convince you to move to a different<strong> prefecture</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kresobilan">kresobilan</a>] 5-3-2008(81): <em>Smaller</em> administrative units, <em>hooked</em> together by a (Sauron&#039;s) central <em>eye</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 25-4-2006(53): Contradictory to what Heisig says, there is no eye of a needle in this picture, because that would be the top part of 直 . Instead, there is the eye of a fishhook. I will not hazard a guess as to what lives in such a place, but in fact the eye of a fishhook - as it has well-defined borders - makes a small<strong> prefecture</strong> of its own.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 22-6-2008(48): <em>Eye</em> (I) live in a <em>small</em> <strong>prefecture</strong> full of <em>hook</em>ers.
