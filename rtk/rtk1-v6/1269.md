2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 3-8-2006(157): <em>Once upon a time</em>, it was thought that the ancient &quot;art&quot; of alchemy could transform anything into <em>gold</em>. At that time, people were obviously<strong> confused</strong> about the difference between reality and myth. (Arguably people are still as<strong> confused</strong> as ever, just about different things now.).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 1-5-2007(49): <em>Once upon a time</em> there were some very<strong> confused</strong> alchemists. They couldn&#039;t understand why they couldn&#039;t turn other metals (i.e. lead) into gold. (adapted from Raichu).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tummai">tummai</a>] 22-5-2008(39): <em>Once upon a time</em> Metallica used to be a great <em>metal</em> band. Somewhere around 1990 they got<strong> confused</strong> and now they write shitty pop rock songs.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/epangelia2k2">epangelia2k2</a>] 11-5-2008(30): Ahhh senility, when you are<strong> confused</strong> by the everything in the world . . . your <em>golden</em> years are not at all like your <em>salad days</em>.
