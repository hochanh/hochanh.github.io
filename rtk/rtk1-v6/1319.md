1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 19-9-2006(255): Perhaps a pictograph of a soldier&#039;s weapons--his sword and bow-placed ceremonially over his body before burial, while people offer their<strong> condolences</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 24-6-2007(80): Send your<strong> condolences</strong> to the old geezer whom you shot the <em>walking stick</em> into with your <em>bow</em>. (see <a href="../v4/1232.html">pull</a> (#1232 引)).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 12-1-2008(50): Don&#039;t confuse with <a href="../v4/985.html">reparation</a> (#985 償), <a href="../v4/476.html">compensation</a> (#476 賠).<strong> Condolences</strong> aren&#039;t monetary or physical; it&#039;s just a letter. &quot;Dear wife, your bungling soldier husband tried to string his <em>bow</em> with his <em>walking stick</em>, which of course failed. He was promptly killed by enemy fire. Our<strong> condolences</strong>.&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thora">Thora</a>] 30-4-2008(22): A dead soldier&#039;s <em>bow</em> and <em>walking staff</em> unceremoniously delivered to his widow with a note: &quot;Our<strong> condolences</strong>&quot;. That&#039;s it. Heartless. At least &quot;consolation&quot; has some &quot;heart&quot;. [In case you used a soldier&#039;s death in both stories].

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 17-6-2009(14): The enemy archer kills your friend. Then, seeing how upset you are, he mocks you by offering his<strong> condolences</strong> by using his <em>bow</em> and <em>walking stick</em> like a violin to play a sad song.
