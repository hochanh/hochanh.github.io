1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 2-3-2007(302): Did anyone else used to put <em>ketchup</em> packets on the <em>ground</em> and jump on them so they spattered on the <strong>wall</strong>?

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saizen">saizen</a>] 4-1-2009(117): Primitive for <strong>Ketchup</strong>: When the taste is too <em>spicy</em> your <em>mouth</em> has basically given up trying to handle it ..or in other words raised the white <em>flag</em> of surrender. But unlike war , putting <strong>Ketchup</strong> on it will usually solve the problem. <strong>Wall</strong>(dingomick); Did anyone else used to put ketchup packets on the <em>ground</em> and jump on them so they spattered on the<strong> wall</strong>?

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kokage">kokage</a>] 21-12-2010(23): Excited about kanji 1500?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cangy">cangy</a>] 26-6-2008(21): The <strong>ketchup</strong> primitive has an even more saucy true meaning: <em>Flag</em> means buttocks, <em>mouth</em> means hole and <em>spicy</em> means penetrate...

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 21-4-2008(14): Heisig mentions <em>ketchup</em>, which I remember by imagining that someone is wiping the <em>ketchup</em> from their <em>mouth</em> with a <em>flag</em>, keeping everyone <em>standing</em> on pins and <em>needles</em>, means <em>false</em> as a kanji. So: the <em>false</em><strong> wall</strong> led to a secret lair under<em>ground</em>.
