1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/krungthep">krungthep</a>] 26-3-2008(198): I threw my<strong> Rin</strong>dows <em>computer</em> off a <em>cliff</em> because it kept crashing. Now, after its last crash, it&#039;s worth less than a<strong> rin</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomusan">tomusan</a>] 16-2-2008(76): A <em>computer</em> dropped off of a <em>cliff</em> would be worth about 1<strong> RIN</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD">PeterJD</a>] 7-4-2008(50): The Square Root of 1 RI = 1<strong> RIN</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu">nolusu</a>] 12-7-2007(33): He dropped his <em>computer</em> from the top of the <em>cliff</em> and it turned to smithe-<strong> rin</strong> -s.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry">elktapestry</a>] 26-3-2007(25): Looking down at the 里 from the high cliff above such a tiny country village looks even smaller like something very very tiny and insignificant... Like a りん /<strong> Rin</strong>. Also might be worth-while to note now that this isn&#039;t just 1/10th of a 銭 but also 1/10th of a 分 or rather... 0.3mm in length. Perhaps imagine holding up a ruler from that high up to measure the tiny speck of a 里 below and note it coming out to 0.3mm in length. <a href="midori://search?text=ずっとずっと小さいですね～">ずっとずっと小さいですね～</a> !!
