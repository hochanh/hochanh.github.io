1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 20-7-2007(208): Water flows down to<strong> destroy</strong> the march of fire.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 26-10-2007(98): Use a <em>water</em> cannon to<strong> destroy</strong> a line of <em>march</em>ing <em>fire</em> monsters. I keep mixing this one up with <a href="../v4/167.html">disaster</a> (#167 災) and <a href="../v4/400.html">demolition</a> (#400 壊). Remember, you<strong> DESTROY</strong> monsters (think of the Godzilla movie &quot;Destroy All Monsters!&quot;). Fires and floods are natural DISASTERs. And DEMOLITION is something you carefully do while wearing protective garments. (vaguely based on stefanot&#039;s balrog story).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583">daredawg3583</a>] 11-12-2007(41): Lord of the Rings: Orcs, all carrying <em>torches</em> (in the night, for visuals) and intent on <em>destroying</em> everything in their path, are utterly<strong> destroy</strong>ed by the releasing of the waters (by the Ents).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gibler">gibler</a>] 21-11-2011(12): I mix this up with 壊 demolition (#400 壊) alll the time, so i need to say: the MARCH to<strong> destroy</strong> TROY (the ancient city). TROY which comes from<strong> desTROY</strong>! They came across the WATER with the horse, secretly MARCHED in the city and BURNED the city down.<strong> DESTROY</strong>: The march of flames on troy. . . 絶滅 ぜつめつ　－　Extinction RTK2:　メツ 滅亡 めつぼう(destruction) 滅ぶ ほろぶ　－　To collapse, go under, be<strong> destroy</strong>ed.　.
