1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 18-9-2006(250): Note: this word in Japanese has the idea of &quot;indignant&quot;. So<strong> aroused</strong> here refers to being<strong> aroused</strong> because of anger over some unjust or wrong act, unfairness etc. It doesn&#039;t seem to carry a meaning associated with arousal in the sense of sex or pleasure. So, my story: think of the angry <em>state of mind</em><strong> aroused</strong> at finding all your <em>clams</em> buried under your <em>haystack</em> stolen, gone!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joesan">joesan</a>] 25-10-2007(68): <em>Data</em> was <strong>aroused/indignant</strong> when he saw what the volcano had done to the farmers building their <em>haystacks</em> and the fishermen collecting their <em>shells</em> . The tragedy of it all <strong>aroused</strong> him so much he didn&#039;t even notice he was feeling emotion.
