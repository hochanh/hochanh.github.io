1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 13-11-2007(155): &quot;<strong>Wherefore</strong> art thou, <em>Sprouteo</em>?&quot; (Juliet has fallen in love with a brussel sprout) (OR: A brussel sprout has fallen from Juliet&#039;s dinner plate and rolled off).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 16-1-2008(152): &quot;Cogito <strong>ergo</strong> sum.&quot;<strong> Wherefore</strong> is a bad choice here for two reasons. For one, it&#039;s often mistranslated as &quot;where&quot; when in fact it&#039;s an urge to know a cause or reason; and two, because this kanji represents the reason, not the urge. [A thought <em>sprouts</em> from my <em>brain</em>. I think, <strong>therefore</strong> I am.].

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 4-7-2007(37): Errata: Stroke order in 4th edition is wrong. The vertical stroke is #3. (story: dingomick).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 26-4-2007(30): &quot;<strong>Wherefore</strong> art thou Romeo?&quot; says Juliet on her balcony as she plucks brussel sprouts instead of rose petals. (This takes on the primitive of the much more memorable <em>BRUSSEL SPROUT</em>).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 16-2-2010(18): <strong>Wherefore</strong> art thou, Romeo. He&#039;s in the <em>rice field</em>. You can see his hair sticking up above the rice. New Primitive: Romeo.
