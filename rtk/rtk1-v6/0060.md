1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 12-11-2008(43): Fortune teller writes your fortune on a piece of paper and tells you to<strong> affix</strong> it to a shell and throw into the ocean for it to come true. Picture licking the back of the shell like a stamp and<strong> affix</strong>ing it to the fortune.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki">CasualTatsumaki</a>] 7-5-2010(25): To prevent confusion with <a href="../v4/1303.html">affixed</a> (#1303 附) I changed this to &quot;paste (v.)&quot; or &quot;cut and paste&quot; because it is the character for pasting in a PC and in graphic design. Careful <a href="../v4/2650.html">paste</a> (#2650 糊) Story: You pay money and the fortune teller cuts and pastes a good fortune and prints it out for you on his notebook PC. 切り貼り きりはり cut and paste, 貼る はる to stick/to paste, 貼付け はりつけ (computer file) paste.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FoxintheStars">FoxintheStars</a>] 8-8-2010(10): (in the new RTK1 supplement as <strong>post a bill</strong>) Under the Sea, clams are used for clips to hang papers, so The Little Mermaid found the Sea Witch after seeing a <strong>posted bill</strong><strong> affix</strong>ed in a <em>clam</em> advertising <em>fortune-telling</em>.
