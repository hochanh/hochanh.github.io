1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 21-2-2007(151): The TREES<strong> FLOURISH</strong> in the CLASSROOM, a little too much perhaps, there&#039;s no room for the students any more.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Francois">Francois</a>] 11-3-2008(95): Students are like young trees. They tend to<strong> flourish</strong> in the schoolhouse.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 24-11-2011(53): Within the <em>schoolhouse</em>, the <em>tree</em> of knowledge does<strong> flourish</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 1-11-2007(31): Knowledge can only truly<strong> flourish</strong> when it is taught openly and freely in the <em>schoolhouse</em>, and not guarded and kept secret like the forbidden <em>tree</em> of knowledge.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Transtic">Transtic</a>] 2-7-2008(30): This is a very special <em>schoolhouse</em>, were <em>trees</em> are taught how to<strong> FLOURISH</strong>. It is important to imagine the image of <em>trees</em> sitting down and taking classes on<strong> FLOURISH</strong>ING in a <em>schoolhouse</em>. You could even use an actual <em>schoolhouse</em> to make your mental image more realistic. You would even imagine the graduation ceremony of a class of sakura flowering all at the same time while holding their diplomas.
