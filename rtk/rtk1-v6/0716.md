1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 13-10-2005(239): In mathematics, a<strong> conjecture</strong> is a mathematical statement which has been proposed as a true statement, but which no one has yet been able to prove or disprove. Have you heard of the <em>Finger-Turkey</em><strong> conjecture</strong> ? It states that if <em>turkeys</em> had <em>fingers</em>, they would be able to count. Be sure to imagine a turkey with fingers at the tip of its wings, counting from one to ten.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 19-7-2007(87): In the midst of<strong> conjecture</strong> on whether it was done or not, mom stuck her <em>fingers</em> in the <em>turkey</em> to check.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/narafan">narafan</a>] 31-7-2007(45): WRONG<strong> conjecture</strong> -&gt; Fingers evolved from turkeys.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 1-12-2008(35): The correct<strong> conjecture</strong> is that <em>fingers</em> evolved INTO <em>turkeys</em>! I&#039;ll prove it to you with a simple piece of paper...<a href="http://www.blogadilla.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/hand-turkey.jpg">http://www.blogadilla.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/hand-turkey.jpg</a>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/unicornpuddlefoot">unicornpuddlefoot</a>] 22-11-2008(25): It may only be<strong> conjecture</strong>, but I think he&#039;s fingured the turkey... lol.
