1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/indigo">indigo</a>] 18-1-2008(190): <strong>Brocade</strong> is the art of sewing <em>gold</em> on a <em>white towel</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 30-8-2007(90): Never heard of this word before encountering it here. So it turns out that the fanciest<strong> brocade</strong> in the world is actually a towel used by a Turkish monarch. It&#039;s embroidered with <em>gold</em> and <em>cocaine</em>. Yes, <em>cocaine</em> - what you thought it&#039;d be something else? That is some true art right there. I think a great many people would want to own this towel.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 12-1-2008(30): &quot;Brocade&quot; means &#039;twisted thread&#039;, and is usually made with gold and silver. Here it is written as a <em>towel</em> woven with <em>gold</em> and <em>white</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zardoz73">zardoz73</a>] 25-8-2008(23): First, the meaning of<strong> brocade</strong> in English: fabric woven with an elaborate design, esp. a raised pattern. Imagine GOLD threads embedded in a WHITE silk TOWEL. I carried my<strong> brocade</strong> to the airport and the GOLD set off the METAL detector!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/duzymichal">duzymichal</a>] 8-7-2009(13): The problem with this kanji was that the towel pictured by me was white in the first place (and I&#039;m not changing colours/shapes/overall appearance of my primitives only to adjust them to new kanji, oh no sir...). So I have a white dove pecking golden<strong> brocade</strong> out of the towel.
