1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mothralad">mothralad</a>] 5-4-2007(258): Worst<strong> post</strong> in history: quality checker at the kazoo factory. Imagine the toll on your ears!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 26-4-2007(146): Buckingham Palace guards are famous for staying at their<strong> post</strong> no matter what, even if you blow a <em>kazoo</em> in their <em>ear</em>!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 30-4-2006(90): You want to leave your<strong> post</strong> when you hear the sound of the fiesta.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 19-11-2006(26): A guard stands at his<strong> post</strong>, listening for approaching intruders. If he hears anyone coming, he must sound out the warning signal -- which is (due to budget cuts) just a kazoo.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/spoonsman">spoonsman</a>] 28-1-2009(16): From Star Wars: Episode IV. &quot;TK-421, why aren&#039;t you at your<strong> post</strong>? TK-421, why aren&#039;t you at your<strong> post</strong>?&quot; Han, in the Stormtrooper uniform, points to his <em>ear</em>, indicating he can&#039;t hear. The commander turns to a guard. &quot;We probably just sound like a <em>kazoo buzzing</em> in his <em>ear</em>. Go check him out.&quot; Han then busts through the door and kills everyone on the Death Star.
