1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wasurenaide">wasurenaide</a>] 13-5-2007(313): Remember the SUPERFLUOUS<strong> CROWN</strong> that flew away in the WIND? Well now the king is saying &quot;i should have had the thing GLUED to my head from the BEGINNING&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 12-7-2007(133): A <strong>crown</strong>, from the <em>beginning</em> of the new king&#039;s life, is <em>glued</em> to him. He must inherit it.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Samchan">Samchan</a>] 18-2-2009(14): I liked wasurenaide&#039;s story, but the superfluous and wind bits just confused me, so changed it a bit: Remember the<strong> CROWN</strong> that kept falling off the kings big shiny bald head while he&#039;s making a long speech? Well now the king is saying &quot;i should have had the thing GLUED to my head from the BEGINNING&quot;.
