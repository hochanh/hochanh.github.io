1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hyland1">Hyland1</a>] 30-4-2007(281): Here we see the evil tyrannizing tiger. What is on his chest? A giant E, for EVIL, of course.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 7-1-2007(69): The &quot;E&quot; shape actually means claws here, and the real etymology is a tiger tyrannizing other animals with its claws (the etymologies actually make sense once in a blue moon!). I think of the claws here as two hooks, representing the front paws. (stroke order of that part: <a href="midori://search?text=二＋">二＋</a> last of 直 ).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ezmoreldo">ezmoreldo</a>] 30-6-2008(19): The way to<strong> tyrannize</strong> a tiger is to stroke it&#039;s fur the wrong way with a broom (you don&#039;t want to use a comb because he&#039;ll eat you.).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 17-6-2007(6): The father<strong> tyrannize</strong>d the kids by keeping a hungry tiger in a box. In fact, one of the kids has already been fed...

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 9-10-2007(5): In &quot;The Ghost and the Darkness&quot;, an evil <em>tiger</em> with an <em>E</em> on it&#039;s chest<strong> tyrannize</strong>s the railroad builders. Thanks Hyland1!
