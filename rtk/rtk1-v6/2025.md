1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 27-7-2008(190): This is a simple two-column manga showing the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a<strong> cocoon</strong>. First, the caterpillar gets under a large flower (bees tend to hang around flowers, which scare away other predators). Then, in the first frame, we see the caterpillar (<em>insect</em>). Then, a bar separating this frame from the next frame (remember that Japanese manga run the other way!), in which we see the <em>insect</em> covered with <em>thread</em>, making a beautiful<strong> cocoon</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eightyd">eightyd</a>] 15-8-2009(172): I dont like lesson 51 so far.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gdaxeman">gdaxeman</a>] 14-1-2008(82): The magic <em>flower</em> is the reason why <em>Spider-Man</em> ended up miniaturized and confined inside a <em>hood</em>-like <strong>cocoon</strong> together with an <em>insect</em>. Now, only a <em>walking stick</em> separates them both.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alucard">Alucard</a>] 19-1-2007(45): See book, one of the good stories you can remember from there.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattimus">mattimus</a>] 20-11-2009(31): <em>Spider-Man</em> bent over to pick up a pretty <em>flower</em> when a giant <em>glass hood</em> dropped over him- it&#039;s a trap! Now he&#039;s stuck inside, fending off a swarm <em>insect</em> with his <em>walking stick</em> as they try to wrap him in a<strong> cocoon</strong>. Could this be the end of <em>Spider-Man</em>?!
