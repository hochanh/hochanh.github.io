1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 17-5-2007(110): Good thing I brought some <em>thread</em>, cause I need to<strong> sew</strong> my pants that I tore up <em>walking through the bushes</em> (see <a href="../v4/1562.html">summit</a> (#1562 峰)) before we hit the <em>road</em> to go back down the mountain.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skinnyneo">skinnyneo</a>] 25-11-2007(94): <em>Spiderman</em> while <em>walking through bushes</em> chasing a villain, rips his suit and stops on the road to<strong> sew</strong> it up.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 5-6-2008(72): <em>Spider man</em> has to<strong> sew</strong> a new costume. He slipped while web swinging and fell on a bunch of <em>pointy</em> stuff in the <em>road</em>. Ouch! (See Mcfate&#039;s <a href="../v4/1562.html">summit</a> (#1562 峰) story for the &quot;pointy&quot; primitive).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 27-12-2008(29): <em>Spiderman</em> has to<strong> sew</strong> his spider suit after the <em><a href="../v4/2417.html">tryst</a> (#2417 逢)</em> last night. (He had to keep his suit on during the tryst to keep his anonymity).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 26-11-2007(25): After a 逢 <a href="../v4/2417.html">tryst</a> (#2417 逢), they will <strong>sew</strong> a scarlet letter to your clothes with red <em>thread</em>. Or at least, that&#039;s how it used to be done.
