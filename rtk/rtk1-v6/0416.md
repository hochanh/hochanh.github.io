2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 30-8-2007(73): The little Dutch boy has his finger stuck in the<strong> dike</strong>, and that&#039;s the only thing keeping his town from going under. He really really needs to go to the bathroom though, so he devises a plan to carefully add a bit of dirt - there, place individual bits in <strong>just so</strong> - there, I think it&#039;s good enough. Pull it out -----yes! Success!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu">nolusu</a>] 16-7-2007(24): The<strong> dike</strong> was very close to breaking. The people worked all <em>day</em> bringing <em>earth/soil</em> to <em>mend</em> it.
