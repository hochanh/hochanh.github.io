1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 4-1-2007(157): The amount of &quot;fur&quot; (needles) on a Christmas tree<strong> decrease</strong>s, until it doesn&#039;t look all that good.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 8-3-2008(115): Real fur coats and real christmas trees are dereasing the last couple of years. Plasctic chrismas trees and fake fur it is nowadays.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kusterdu">kusterdu</a>] 30-4-2008(41): A marketing survey shows that there has been a<strong> decrease</strong> in Christmas trees sales. It turns out, many very stupid people confused a fir tree with a &quot;fur&quot; tree, and because &quot;fur is murder&quot; stopped buying the trees.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 20-12-2008(36): Christmas Tree + Fur: The<strong> decrease</strong> in the purchases of <em>furry christmas trees</em> is a result of protest from animal rights activists and nature lovers.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dtstutz">dtstutz</a>] 15-2-2009(27): Sorry,<strong> decrease</strong> is too generic to remember... I bought my sister a <strong>de-creaser</strong> (a clothing maintenance device similar to an iron) after she complained about her <strong>fur coats</strong> getting all <strong>creased</strong> and wrinkled. But it was only November, so it had to sit for a while under the <strong>Christmas tree</strong> in a wrapped box waiting for someone to open it up and use it to <strong>de-crease</strong> something.
