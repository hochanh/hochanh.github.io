1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 16-5-2007(231): I asked my teacher what this strange <em>word</em> meant, and she furiously replied that it was explained in the<strong> above-stated</strong> paragraph before throwing an <em>acorn</em> at me!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/guidedog">guidedog</a>] 5-2-2007(99): The<strong> above-stated</strong> <em>words</em> are the <em>acorn</em> from which the following statement grows.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 24-7-2008(79): I literally imagined atree with <em>words</em> stuck on <em>acorns</em>. And thus the <em>words</em> are<strong> above-stated</strong> (that is until they fall on your head I guess). (This one really needs a mental picture).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cornrow">cornrow</a>] 16-12-2008(26): <strong>ABOVE-STATED</strong> is a synonym with ACORNmentioned. I mean &quot;aforementioned&quot;. Really easy to remember if you just think of ACORNmentioned.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 10-2-2008(12): You, a hog, just asked what the word means. Socrates answers:&#039;The meaning of this word is stated above&#039; &#039;yes, but I don&#039;t understand the kanji.&#039; S:&#039;Well it is stated above&#039; &#039; I just told you that I dont understand it.&#039; S:&#039;The word is stated above&#039;&#039;Yes but...&#039; S:&#039; You dum hog, stated above is the word&#039;... this could go on for a while as the kanji you are pointing to is 該 .
