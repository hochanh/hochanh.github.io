1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Copycatken">Copycatken</a>] 30-6-2006(204): He was stabbed with a <em>dagger</em>, and <em>little</em> drops of<strong> red</strong> blood dropped onto the <em>ground</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django">Django</a>] 30-9-2007(55): There was<strong> red</strong> all over the <em>soil</em> after Little<strong> Red</strong> Riding Hood plunged a <em>dagger</em> into the wolf. Those two dots we see are wolfies <em>animal legs</em> we see, by the way (a la smithsonian).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 25-1-2007(24): (I prefer to use <em>animal legs</em> instead of <em>little</em> so as not to resort to combining it with <em>dagger</em>:) The cow refused to leave the temple <em>grounds</em>, even when it was threatened with a <em>dagger</em>. Its <em>animal legs</em> just stayed planted firmly there so it could show its devotion to Buddha. This is the story of &#039;&#039;akabeko&#039;&#039;, the<strong> red</strong> cow, a popular myth in the Aizu region of Japan.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jmcanally">jmcanally</a>] 10-2-2010(13): This is a mass grave for <em>animal and human legs</em>. The serial killer is a Japanese guy with short legs and long-leg envy, so he cuts off legs that are longer than his and buries them here. Notice that since the legs have been cut off one-by-one and tossed in the grave randomly so the animal legs look a bit far apart and the human legs look a bit different than usual (direction of the curve of the right leg is opposite the usual). The <em>ground</em> is still<strong> RED</strong> with from all the blood spilled.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 15-10-2009(12): The <em>soil</em> was<strong> red</strong> after the hunter used his <em>dagger</em> to cut off the <em>animal&#039;s legs</em>.
