1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 23-8-2007(213): A vegetarian vulture is munching on a <em>flower</em>, perched on a <em>tree</em>, patiently waiting for a patch of<strong> vegetable</strong>s to grow.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dshill99">dshill99</a>] 5-6-2008(98): <em><a href="../v4/2090.html">grab</a> (#2090 采)</em> beneath the <em>flowers</em> to get the<strong> vegetable</strong>s. 野菜 やさい.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 18-12-2007(86): Wolverine is turning into total hippie. He said he only eats<strong> vegetable</strong>s now and last time I saw him sitting in a tree with flowers in his hair.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tuuli">tuuli</a>] 30-1-2008(21): Nobody likes to eat their<strong> vegetable</strong>s, not even <em>vultures</em> who will eat anything. So they hide in a <em>flower</em>-covered <em>tree</em>, until the scary<strong> vegetable</strong>s disappear. Picture the ugly vulture head peeking out from behind the flowers.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/delbertmon">delbertmon</a>] 26-11-2009(15): Tip: vulture + tree : Heisig later combines these into a single kanji 采 called grab (<strong>2090). --- Story: Many<strong> vegetable</strong>s are roots and so you take their flowers and grab them in order to harvest the<strong> vegetable</strong>. --- REF: &quot;grab&quot; also appears in pick (</strong>733), coloring (#1714 彩).
