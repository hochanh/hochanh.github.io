1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 11-10-2005(198): Imagine a white bird loosing a <em>couple feathers</em> as it is<strong> learn</strong>ing to fly. You<strong> learn</strong> a lesson as you watch it doing so, maybe you<strong> learn</strong> that “nothing comes for free” or that “one has to be prepared to loose in order to gain”...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/avparker">avparker</a>] 18-12-2007(76): By the time you&#039;re old and all your <em>feather</em>s have turned <em>white</em>, you should have <strong>learn</strong>ed a thing or two.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Howdoken">Howdoken</a>] 12-1-2008(63): <strong>Learn</strong>ing is all about adding more <em>feathers</em> to your cap and the most prestigious of all is the beautiful pure <em>white</em> feather you&#039;ll receive when you have<strong> learn</strong>ed the kanji!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LordGolem">LordGolem</a>] 21-4-2008(25): Little birds with <em>white feathers</em> still have a lot to<strong> learn</strong>. When their plumage will be mature enough they&#039;ll be ready to fly away. To help not confusing it with <a href="../v4/324.html">study</a> (#324 学), think birds don&#039;t need to study in order to<strong> learn</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Istvan">Istvan</a>] 28-6-2007(23): I&#039;m<strong> learn</strong>ing to fly...but I ain&#039;t got wings.....I just got two feathers....on top of some white thing....
