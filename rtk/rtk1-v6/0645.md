1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/narafan">narafan</a>] 25-7-2007(293): A <em>samurai&#039;</em>s <strong>intentions</strong> always come from the <em>heart</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amthomas">amthomas</a>] 17-1-2007(107): <em>Gentleman</em> always have <em>hearts</em> full of good<strong> intention</strong>s.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 1-9-2007(42): <em>Tom Cruise</em> no doubt had good<strong> intention</strong>s when he made the Last <em>Samurai</em> - his heart in the right place (right there, down to earth). Too bad the concept of a white dude as the last samurai is ridiculous, if not offensive. Picture Tom Cruise in a press conference being asked about this, at which point he jumps on a heart-shaped, grabs somebody&#039;s hands, and screams BUT MY<strong> INTENTION</strong>S WERE FROM THE HEART! SCIENTOLOGY HELPS PEOPLE.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wazato">wazato</a>] 3-10-2007(29): A samurai shows up at the door to pick up his date. Her father asks, &quot;What are your<strong> intention</strong>s with my daughter?&quot; He responds that his<strong> intention</strong>s come from the heart.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nekoyaki">nekoyaki</a>] 9-4-2009(19): Father: &quot;What are your<strong> intention</strong>s to my daughter?&quot;. <em>Samurai</em>: &quot;I intend to give her my <em>heart</em>! (slices out his own heart and hands it over).
