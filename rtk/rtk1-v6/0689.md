1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 17-4-2007(231): If you grind the <em>hemp</em> without a stone but use your <em>hand</em> instead it will<strong> chafe</strong>. (Image: &quot;Robin, why are your hands all<strong> chafe</strong>d?&quot; &#039;Uh... (I&#039;ve been grinding hemp all day)&#039;).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Amadan">Amadan</a>] 9-7-2008(105): Imagine sliding down a <em>hemp</em> rope, without gloves, just bare <em>hands</em>.<strong> Chafe</strong>s, doesn&#039;t it?

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scout">scout</a>] 8-12-2007(47): When the feds came to bust your little <em>hemp</em> <em>grove</em>, you jumped out the back side of the <em>cave</em> and tried to repel down with a <em>hemp</em> rope. Unfortunately, the rope<strong> chafe</strong>d your <em>hands</em> and you fell .. ouch!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 28-10-2005(12): Think of<strong> chafe</strong> in the sense of “friction” for this particular kanji. There are many garments made of <em>hemp</em> (though maybe not gloves). Contemporary <em>hemp</em> clothes are likely very comfortable, but for this story let&#039;s imagine rudimentary gloves which are coarse and rough like the unprocessed <em>hemp</em> fiber, and hence,<strong> chafe</strong> your <em>hands</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rowdyphantom">rowdyphantom</a>] 3-1-2010(7): Growing <em>hemp</em><strong> chafe</strong>s your <em>hand</em>s.
