1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 24-2-2008(211): A <strong>building</strong> that <em>eats</em> <em>bureaucrats</em>!!!!!!!!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 17-6-2006(163): This<strong> Bldg.</strong> is like all the other government buildings - they house <em>bureaucrats</em> who sit around sipping wine and <em>eating</em> expensive meals at the taxpayers expense.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 25-9-2008(40): The <em>bureaucrat</em> never goes out for lunch, always choosing to <em>eat</em> in the<strong> Bldg.</strong>

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jamestaverner">jamestaverner</a>] 21-2-2008(15): Empire State <strong>Building</strong> (to avoid confusing with <a href="../v4/591.html">government office</a> (#591 庁) and <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1304">Inst.</a> (#1304 院)). <em>McDonalds</em> lobbies the <em>bureaucrats</em> by treating them to a lavish feast at the top of the Empire State <strong>Building</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BlackMarsh">BlackMarsh</a>] 8-1-2006(11): As this is a type of abbreviation you can assume that the building type is that of a government organisation. And we all know the type of people found in these &quot;bldgs&quot; - fat bureaucrats who have eaten too much food.
