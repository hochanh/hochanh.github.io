How about this: the phrase &quot;shape up or<strong> ship</strong> out!&quot; This phrase originally meant that a soldier had better get his act together, or else face being<strong> ship</strong>ped off into a combat zone. Here we see a poor WW-I soldier who has been<strong> ship</strong>ped off to a combat zone. He&#039;s riding in the <em>boat</em> overseas to fight in the <em>trenches</em> (<em>gulley</em>).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yuriehoshii">yuriehoshii</a>] 1-6-2011(8): THUYỀN : A<strong> SHIP</strong> IS A BIG BOAT HAS AT LEAST 8 BOXES (CARGO HOLD ).
