3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 23-3-2008(58): A true (?) story about Captain Cook and sauerkraut. Cook was convinced that sauerkraut would prevent the disease scurvy among his sailors, but his problem was getting his sailors to eat the stuff. He tricked the low-ranking <em>cadets</em> into eating sauerkraut by storing it in <em>wood</em><strong> vat</strong>s labeled &quot;for officers&#039; use only&quot;. The <em>cadets</em> thus believed that they were being unfairly denied access to the officers-only<strong> vat</strong>s, so they secretly stole and ate the sauerkraut - which was exactly what Cook wanted them to do.
