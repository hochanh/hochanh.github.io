1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Transtic">Transtic</a>] 28-4-2008(170): The most famous<strong> LINER</strong> is the Titanic, which struck an iceberg and sunk. Just imagine that huge<strong> LINER</strong> strucking an even huger mass of <strong>white</strong> ice.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew">Matthew</a>] 1-7-2006(92): A<strong> liner</strong> is to <em>boat</em> as an <a href="../v4/261.html">emperor</a> (#261 皇) is to a <a href="../v4/255.html">king</a> (#255 王), or a <a href="../v4/967.html">chief</a> (#967 伯) is to a <a href="../v4/951.html">person</a> (#951 人): in each case we need only add <em>white</em> to the latter in order to get the former.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 20-6-2008(57): Cruise<strong> Liner</strong>s are huge <em>boats</em> that always seem to be <em>white</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adrianbarritt">adrianbarritt</a>] 29-8-2007(44): Titanic was a big <em>boat</em> built by the <em>White</em> Star <em>Line</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DeKleft">DeKleft</a>] 5-12-2007(9): Noah&#039;s Ark was probably the first <em>boat</em> ever that might be considered a<strong> liner</strong>. Hey! there&#039;s the <em>white dove</em> that Noah sent out, and he has an olive branch in his beak!
