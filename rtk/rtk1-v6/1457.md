1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 24-9-2007(187): <em>Spiderman</em> can <strong>spin</strong> his webs in any <em>direction</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django">Django</a>] 25-10-2007(94): &quot;You keep me<strong> spinning</strong> right round, baby right round, like a <em>compass</em> baby.&quot; <em>Spidey</em> is making a retro 80s music video,<strong> spinning</strong> right round on his giant <em>compass</em>, singing his favourite song.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 15-1-2008(50): The easiest way to spin some <em>threads</em> is to hook them up to a <em>compass</em> and take them to the North Pole. The compass will spin like crazy and the threads will spin with it. I confuse this with <a href="../v4/1967.html">swing</a> (#1967 揺).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adhmm">adhmm</a>] 16-11-2007(38): Spiderman is<strong> spinning</strong> around, shooting webs in every direction.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blueraccoon">blueraccoon</a>] 25-2-2009(8): A normal spider <strong>spins</strong> a web into a specific pattern in order to catch prey. <em>Spiderman</em>, however, uses his web primarily as a mode of transportation, shooting it in all <em>directions</em>.
