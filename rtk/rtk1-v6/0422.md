1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 24-6-2008(174): The virgin<strong> bridegroom</strong> tries to understand the new, mysterious <em>part of</em> his <em>woman&#039;s body</em> - but with little success. It&#039;s a <em>zoo</em> down there! (primitives placement: the part of the body is &#039;down there&#039; - the woman is &#039;left&#039; unsatisfied).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 30-8-2007(122): The only reason anyone talks about a<strong> bridegroom</strong> is if they&#039;re about to or have just gotten married. Of course, then you have to go on your honeymoon. So you take your <em>woman</em> to the <em>zoo</em> for a <em>month.</em> Pretty cool honeymoon.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yawfosu88">yawfosu88</a>] 3-3-2008(73): Imagine a<strong> bridegroom</strong> having his wedding with his <em>woman</em> in a <em>zoo</em> on the <em>moon.</em> That will impress her! Fill out the details with the bride and groom floating with a menagerie of animals with astronaut helmets floating, bumping and attacking one another.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/munia">munia</a>] 15-8-2008(32): How did the eccentric<strong> bridegroom</strong> convince the <em>woman</em> to marry him? He built a <em>zoo</em> in the surface of the <em>moon</em> just for her!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 24-1-2008(29): The <strong>bridegroom</strong> will take his <em>woman</em> to the <em>zoo</em> for a <em>month</em> long honeymoon. (Simplifying dihutenosa).
