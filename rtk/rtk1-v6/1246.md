1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 9-3-2011(224): There&#039;s a tendency in Japan to make the younger members (kouhai) clean up after the older members (senpai) of a group, which results in a lot of grumbling and whining. &quot;Well<strong> old boy</strong>,&quot; a senpai might say, &quot;If you did as much work with the <em>mop</em> as you do with your <em>mouth,</em> you would have been done an hour ago&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stefanot">stefanot</a>] 22-1-2007(69): The Beatles, english<strong> old boy</strong>s, had hairs like <em>mop</em> and a good singing <em>mouth</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raseru">raseru</a>] 6-4-2008(46): 君 [kimi] is said by the<strong> old boy</strong> to the younger boy, never the other way around as it would be an insult.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 11-1-2008(32): For this character I think of the Korean movie &quot;<strong>oldboy</strong>&quot;, in which the protagonist has hair like a <em>mop</em> and a <em>mouth</em> that screams in agony. If you have not seen it you really should it&#039;s great, I won&#039;t spoil the ending...you won&#039;t see it coming :).
