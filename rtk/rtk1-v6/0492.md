1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 17-5-2008(78): Flower, siesta: The muchacho was not careful. He passed the warning signs and decided to hold a <em>siesta</em> in the<strong> kudzu</strong> field. The<strong> kudzu</strong> grew so fast, he was completely covered by it in a few hours and not able to escape. Now, the<strong> kudzu</strong> <em>flowers</em> mark his grave.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(15): The muchacho takes a <em>siesta</em> under the <em>flowers</em> of the<strong> kudzu</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 11-1-2009(10): <strong>Kudzu</strong> is a <em>flowering</em> plant that never takes a <em>siesta</em>...it grows constantly and has already overtaken most of the southeastern United States. Beware the<strong> kudzu</strong>!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aaroncp">aaroncp</a>] 21-2-2011(6): Ok so I don&#039;t know about anyone else, but the bottom part of this kanji does not look like <em>siesta</em> on this site. In the supplement pdf it does, but not here so I came up with this:<strong> Kudzu</strong> vines and <em>flowers</em> grow so fast by <em>day</em> that by night they have <em>bound up</em> all the <em>animal legs</em> in the forest like <em>fish hooks</em> bind fish. It is long and convoluted, but it contains everything similar to the elements here.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amillerchip">amillerchip</a>] 8-1-2012(3): My Windows font is displaying the traditional form of this character, however the bottom primitive is <em>siesta</em> as listed. A couple of links to confirm: <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/845b/browsertest.htm">http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/845b/browsertest.htm</a> <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/%E8%91%9B">http://jisho.org/kanji/details/%E8%91%9B</a> Also I&#039;d never heard of<strong> kudzu</strong> before, so thought I might as well rename this to <strong>くず</strong> and learn the reading too.
