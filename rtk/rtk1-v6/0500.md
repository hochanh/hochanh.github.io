1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 6-12-2007(184): <em>Every</em> drop of <em>water</em> will eventually return to the<strong> sea</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 9-8-2008(22): As depicted in the classic SF film <em>Fantastic Voyage</em>, every drop of water is a<strong> sea</strong>, if you look close enough. Imagine peering through a microscope at a vast<strong> sea</strong> teeming with microbial life (and perhaps a minaturized submarine). <strong>Note:</strong> Take care not to confuse with <a href="../v4/549.html">ocean</a> (#549 洋).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ceryn">Ceryn</a>] 24-3-2008(17): &quot;WATER, WATER, EVERYwhere, And all the boards did shrink; WATER, WATER, EVERYwhere, Nor any drop to drink.&quot; Remember to take enough water with you when you go out to<strong> SEA</strong> or die like the sailors in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kiisu">kiisu</a>] 28-2-2008(16): There is water in every<strong> sea</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wasurenaide">wasurenaide</a>] 8-8-2007(11): My way of distinguishing this from <a href="../v4/549.html">ocean</a> (#549 洋) 海 -うみ rhymes with<strong> sea</strong> 洋服 -ようふく (first syllable) rhymes with (first syllable) ocean.
