1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 15-11-2007(241): Years-Months-Days: It takes many years for a <em>cliff</em> to form or erode. A <em>tree</em> takes many months to grow. But <em>days</em> pass by regularly - so in this way, we see the movement of time such as with a<strong> CALENDAR</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cbogart">cbogart</a>] 21-9-2006(122): This is just a picture of a wall<strong> calendar</strong> with a page for each month. The bottom half has the grid of days, the top half has a pretty picture of a forest this month. The cliff radical here is the top and left edges of the paper. You can see the paper curling up at the lower left where a breeze is trying to turn the page.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 31-7-2007(68): You can use a<strong> calendar</strong> to count the number of DAYs it takes to grow two TREES under a CLIFF.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura">taikura</a>] 13-1-2009(47): <strong>Calendar; almanac.</strong> A<strong> calendar</strong> measures time in years, months and days. A <em>cliff</em> (厂) takes years to form; a <em>grove</em> ( 木木 ) of trees takes months to grow; but the <em>sun</em> ( 日 ) rises and falls every day. All of these periods can be recorded in a<strong> calendar</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ningen">Ningen</a>] 1-9-2008(28): I love those nature<strong> CALENDAR</strong>s with all the photos of <em>cliffs</em> and <em>trees</em> and the setting <em>sun</em>.
