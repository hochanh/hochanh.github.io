1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/calittle">calittle</a>] 22-9-2007(162): Primitive <strong>cannons</strong> fired <em>stones</em> <em>wrapped</em> with poisonous snakes.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dshill99">dshill99</a>] 23-4-2008(131): <strong>Cannon</strong> = <em>stone</em> projectile <em>wrapped</em> by a barrel.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall">pmbeddall</a>] 25-10-2007(23): A <em>stone</em> <em>wrap</em>ped in smoke blazes from the mouth of a<strong> cannon</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(20): Picture a very powerful<strong> cannon</strong> (such as on pirate ships), only this one&#039;s on an island, and pointed at the sea. It&#039;s recoil had to be dealt with somehow, so it is placed in a tight-fitting alcove of <em>stone</em>. Hence &quot;<em>stone-wrapped</em><strong> cannon</strong>&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 3-1-2011(16): Rather than a<strong> cannon</strong>, think of a catapult or trebuchet. Both these siege engines fire a large <em>stone</em> that is initially <em>wrapped</em> up or cradled in some fashion. 鉄砲 (てっぽう) : gun.
