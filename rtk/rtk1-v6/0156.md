1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 21-9-2006(174): If you ask your <em>teenager</em> if what he&#039;s drinking is <em>water</em> (and not Vodka), he will answer &quot;but of course&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD">PeterJD</a>] 10-4-2008(137): キョウ<strong> But of course</strong>, this character really means &quot;situation/condition&quot;. &quot;Elder brother gulped some water and said, &#039;What the hell was Heisig&#039;s mental CONDITION when he came up with this definition? Heisig must have a drinking CONDITION.<strong> But of course</strong>, if Heisig sticks to water, rather than sake (like me, <em>water</em> quaffing, situation assessing, sober <em>elder brother</em>), his SITUATION may improve.&#039;&quot;　[MODEL COMPOUND: 状況 (じょうきょう)　state of affairs; conditions].

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 15-9-2008(61): A wet teenager is good ,<strong> but of course</strong> it is illegal.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 11-12-2006(35): This kanji is actually used the normally in the words &quot; 況して &quot; and &quot; 況や &quot;, which mean &quot;Even more so...&quot; or &quot;Even less so...&quot; depending on the context. So, everyone should use <em>water</em> to clean themselves, <em>even more so</em> <em>teenagers</em> prone to body odors.
