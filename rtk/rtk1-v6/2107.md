1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 15-3-2007(190): &quot;Don&#039;t be <strong>foolish</strong>!&quot; says <em>Jiminy Cricket</em> as he lashes you with his belt. Follow logic, like me, not your <em>heart</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 20-3-2007(39): I simply imagine <em>Jiminy Cricket</em> jumping all over the place, like a mad man, yelling &quot;yeeeeehaaaaa!&quot;. Maybe he just fell in love? Mnemonic - &quot;<em>Jiminy Cricket</em> has a<strong> foolish</strong> <em>heart</em>&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/redskatz">redskatz</a>] 8-4-2009(31): It&#039;d be <strong>foolish</strong> to follow <em>Jiminy Cricket&#039;s</em> advice in matters of the <em>heart</em>. After all, you never see him around any girl crickets, do you?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/busaiku">busaiku</a>] 7-1-2010(11): &quot;Do you think I&#039;ll ever have an <em>heart</em> like a real child&quot; asks Pinoccio to <em>Jiminy Cricket</em>. In an unexpected reaction, he laughs at him:&quot;My dear child, that&#039;s the<strong> foolish</strong> thing I ever heard&quot;. Boy, those old fairy tales sure were crude.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 2-5-2009(10): I know you think it was<strong> foolish</strong> of me to give my <em>heart</em> to a <em>long tailed monkey</em> 禺, but we have a healthy relationship based on mutual love and trust! ... Okay, maybe we&#039;re both just idiots.
