5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 7-6-2006(9): When this primitive is on the left as <em>state of mind</em>, I had a hard time visualizing it. Thus I have created the following story. All the smartest people in the country were fed up with their state governments. These great <em>minds</em> joined together and created their own official <em>state</em>: the <em>state of Mind</em>. I visualize it as a small, sectioned off area with brains floating around. A scientific utopia.
