1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu">Kurisu</a>] 28-1-2008(586): They all say they have a <em>TREE</em> between their <em>WALKING LEGS</em> but most only have a <strong>TWIG</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 8-11-2007(103): Don&#039;t confuse with branch or bough - think of snapping<strong> twig</strong>s. A<strong> twig</strong> is always the kind of <em>wood</em> that snaps when the hunter&#039;s <em>walking legs</em> just barely touch it, making a snapping sound that alerts the prey to the hunter&#039;s presence.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/noname">noname</a>] 11-6-2008(50): I don&#039;t believe this means<strong> twig</strong> as in a tree<strong> twig</strong>. 条 【じょう】 (n) (1) article (in document); provision; (2) stripe; streak; line. STORY: If TREES had WALKING LEGS they would march right up to congress and demand they put in a new ARTICLE into the constitution against deforestation.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 13-11-2009(24): (Doesn&#039;t mean<strong> twig</strong>!) I read an <strong>article</strong> in the Weekly World News about a <em>walking</em> <em>tree</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wasurenaide">wasurenaide</a>] 8-5-2007(14): I once read an <strong>ARTICLE</strong> about a guy who shoved a <strong>TREE</strong> between his <em>WALKING LEGS</em>. he was pulling out<strong> TWIG</strong>s for a long time.
