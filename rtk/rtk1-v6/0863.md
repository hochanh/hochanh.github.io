1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Austin">Austin</a>] 28-10-2005(281): Compared to pants, a<strong> SKIRT</strong> is the GARMENT to be wearing when you want to use one of those Japanese toilets. It makes it so much easier: you just walk in the OUTHOUSE hike it up, and do your business.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 29-6-2008(60): Haven&#039;t you ever noticed that the men / women signs on the front of <em>outhouses</em> are sometimes very similar? The silhouettes are usually the same, but one will decidedly be wearing a <em>garment</em> in the shape of a<strong> SKIRT</strong>. Also, we&#039;ve already learned the kanji for &quot;woman&quot;, so if the signs are only in kanji you have no right to wander in and claim ignorance, perv!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hunchbag">hunchbag</a>] 5-11-2009(40): A<strong> skirt</strong> is the most convenient <em>outhouse garment</em>!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kansaigaijin">kansaigaijin</a>] 13-2-2009(12): Women go to the <em>outhouse</em> by lifting up their <strong>skirt</strong> and under <em>garment</em>s, then laying down a nasty fart laced squirt shit.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/notgoing2argue">notgoing2argue</a>] 11-5-2007(11): In an <em>outhouse, garments</em> can get ruined easily so you might want to hike up your<strong> SKIRT</strong> Nancy.
