1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jimsublimeman">jimsublimeman</a>] 3-7-2007(232): I think of an<strong> anti-</strong>hero (Dirty Harry etc.) for this primitive, whose trademark for disposing of villians is not an honorable fight, but a kick in the <em>crotch</em> and then a shove off a <em>cliff</em> (perhaps whilst the villain&#039;s back is turned).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 4-3-2007(104): Many cultures are so<strong> anti-</strong>sex you&#039;d think they just want people to throw their <em>crotches</em> over a <em>cliff</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Transtic">Transtic</a>] 9-1-2008(60): Some people are using an<strong> ANTI-</strong>hero for this one, and it seems a good idea. The problem is... what<strong> ANTI-</strong>hero can you relate to <strong>crotch</strong>? Well, the answer is.................. . ハードゲイでえええええええええええええす！フォォォォォォォォォォォォォー！ (If you don&#039;t know Hard Gay, just look it up on Youtube. You&#039;ll remember this kanji, that&#039;s guaranteed.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 27-11-2008(25): A group of people protesting against something expose their crotches at the top of a cliff. They&#039;re shaking their naked posteriors up in the air, with the letters a-n-t-i- spelled on their buttocks, as a sign of protestation. * You can use the image of the “anti-” protesters shaking their naked posteriors up in the air for the primitive.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Chaze">Chaze</a>] 16-11-2010(22): Despite their stunning similarity, this is not a <a href="../v4/704.html">friend</a> (#704 友), but the opposite: An <strong>anti-friend</strong>! Instead of always being at your side he throws you off a <em>cliff</em>.
