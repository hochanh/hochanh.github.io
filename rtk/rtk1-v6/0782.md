1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 7-5-2006(121): Pretty obvious: to<strong> return</strong> is to turn back on the road you&#039;re on and go the opposite way.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/etpan">etpan</a>] 16-7-2008(98): <strong>Return</strong> here means &quot;return something&quot; rather than &quot;go back&quot;. So here it goes, for those of you who are also suffering of the Japanese summer ;-) I ordered an <em>anti</em> mosquito kit, but it was damaged on the <em>way</em> so I had to<strong> return</strong> it.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jimsublimeman">jimsublimeman</a>] 6-11-2007(67): In &quot;The<strong> Return</strong> of the <em>anti-hero</em>&quot;, Clint Eastwood kicks the villain in the crotch, pushes them off the cliff and onto a busy <em>highway</em>. A tiring movie franchise to say the least....

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 15-6-2009(44): If you&#039;re ANTI-ROAD then of course, you&#039;ll just<strong> return</strong> home.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cullingsong">cullingsong</a>] 16-11-2008(36): I am not sure why, but I bought a road. Why did I do that? I hate roads. I&#039;m anti road! I&#039;d rather fly. I&#039;d better see if I can<strong> return</strong> it.
