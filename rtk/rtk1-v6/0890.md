1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 26-2-2008(250): I promise to use my <em>ear</em> to do nothing but<strong> listen</strong> ... stick a <em>needle</em> in my <em>eye</em>, cross my <em>heart</em> and hope to die! (Intentionally said backwards to get the order of the primitives correct).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 14-8-2006(115): <strong>Listen</strong>ing to others is different from hearing [1626] with the <em>ear</em>. One must allow the words to pierce through the <em>eyes</em> (the window of the soul) and reach deep into the <em>heart</em>...a symbol of thinking about and contemplating on what was said, not just the sounds of words spoken. A married man while reading his newspaper, his wife going on about something suddenly, says, &quot;You&#039;re not<strong> listen</strong>ing to me, are you?&quot; He replies, &quot;I heard every word you said. You said...&quot; “Yes, but you&#039;re not<strong> listen</strong>ing.&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 25-1-2006(48): A doctor is<strong> listen</strong>ing as best as he can to someone&#039;s heart, but even with the stethoscope the doctor can not hear anything, because the patient&#039;s heart is &quot;so small it could pass through the eye of a needle&quot; (see frame 400). Contrast with passive &quot;hear&quot; of frame 1626.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jwy2k2">jwy2k2</a>] 10-4-2007(44): When you really<strong> listen</strong> to another person and not just hear them, you use your ears like ten eyes and see their heartfelt meaning.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vertigo959">vertigo959</a>] 24-9-2008(24): To detect lies, <em>Darth Vader</em> turns up his <em>ear</em> piece loud enough so that he can hear someone&#039;s <em>heart</em> beat, and closely<strong> listen</strong>s. チョウ <a href="midori://search?text=聴覚、聴講、聴診器。">聴覚、聴講、聴診器。</a> .
