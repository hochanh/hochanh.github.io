1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 11-7-2007(183): You hang an <em>umbrella</em> upside-down on a hook of the <strong>scales</strong> and fill it with <em>little</em> <em>potatoes</em>. No luck: it weights <strong>too much</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 7-3-2008(147): This is the kanji for 「あまり Amari」, which means <strong>too little</strong> in negative sentences and <strong>too much</strong> in the rest (always with a negative sense). I take the liberty of using the symbol &quot;&gt;&quot; (<strong>more than</strong>, another meaning!!) as the <em>umbrella</em> component, and using <a href="../v4/2.html">two</a> (#2 二) and <a href="../v4/105.html">little</a> (#105 小) for the <em>potato</em> primitive. So, this kanji either means &quot;<em>two</em> much&quot; (more than 2) or &quot;<em>two little</em>&quot;. (thanks, Virtua_leaf and Thunderball!).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BigAmish">BigAmish</a>] 2-7-2008(50): I was worried that my <em>POTATOES</em> were getting<strong> TOO MUCH</strong> direct sunlight so I stood over them with an <em>UMBRELLA</em>. Now they are getting too <em>LITTLE</em> rain! I clearly have<strong> TOO MUCH</strong> free time on my hands.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rowdyphantom">rowdyphantom</a>] 17-11-2009(25): <em>Umbrellas</em> for <em>little potatoes</em>??? That&#039;s<strong> too much</strong>!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Talka">Talka</a>] 12-9-2007(11): You&#039;re weighing potatoes to take from the market but they weigh<strong> too much</strong>. It&#039;s windy, so you hook your umbrella onto the scale hoping to subtract weight by catching the wind&#039;s force. Still<strong> too much</strong> weight. Just give up and select some smaller potatoes, man. Won&#039;t be<strong> too much</strong> weight then.
