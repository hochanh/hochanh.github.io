1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/greenapple">greenapple</a>] 24-5-2006(186): Who&#039;s job is it to oversee the water level on the dam? It&#039;ts<strong> overflow</strong>ing!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 1-3-2007(112): The <em>overseer</em> isn&#039;t doing his job and he lets the slaves <strong>overflow</strong> the sink!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dilandau23">dilandau23</a>] 14-3-2007(30): When <em>water</em><strong> overflow</strong>s it is usually because someone was not properly <em>overseeing</em> the task. Image: A mother talking on the phone, <em>overseeing</em> the drawing her kid&#039;s bath, boiling something on the stove, and breaking up a fight between two of the kids. Something is bound to<strong> overflow</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 22-3-2009(17): This is the <em>overseer</em> from the previous kanji, who was watching the slave wash the dishes. Unfortunately, the reclining <em>overseer</em> fell asleep and didn&#039;t notice when the <em>water</em> starting<strong> overflow</strong>ing from the sink. ............................................................................... An alternate version of this story would be the famous scene from Fantasia where Mickey falls asleep and stops <em>overseeing</em> the brooms bringing in <em>water</em>, so the room<strong> overflow</strong>s.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup">mezbup</a>] 23-6-2009(14): Water will<strong> overflow</strong>... if you do not oversee.
