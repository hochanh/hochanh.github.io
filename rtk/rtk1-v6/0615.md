1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(94): Pictograph. Easy enough.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ceryn">Ceryn</a>] 23-4-2008(63): These days the biggest concern in airline safety is ICE on the WINGS of the plane. Birds that fly long distances also have to worry about getting ICE on their<strong> FEATHERS</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/konakona50">konakona50</a>] 21-9-2008(41): Two wings full of<strong> feathers</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FoxintheStars">FoxintheStars</a>] 5-8-2010(10): Just noting how I use this as a primitive. When it&#039;s in this full form, containing the &quot;ice&quot; element, I try to think of it as <em>penguins</em> or flightless wings. When it&#039;s the variant with straight lines, then it&#039;s <em>feathers</em> or flying wings.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Easytarget">Easytarget</a>] 7-1-2011(7): This is a picture of two exact<strong> feathers</strong> of the ice bird.
