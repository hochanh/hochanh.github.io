1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 1-6-2006(284): <em>Mingling</em> with the <em>powerful</em> can bring you success, bypassing the need for any<strong> merit</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63">ashman63</a>] 17-6-2008(88): There is great<strong> merit</strong> in <em>mingling</em> with the <em>power</em>ful.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama">MeisterLlama</a>] 22-3-2009(22): Once again Heisig makes a keyword that doesn&#039;t make much sense. The real meaning is <strong>effect</strong>/<strong>efficacy</strong> (take your pick). My dad tried out both wearing a top hat and doing some body-building for his muscles to see which was more efficacious .

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/robertmyers">robertmyers</a>] 6-12-2011(15): Father explained to me that the top hat<strong> merit</strong>s attention because it signifies power...with the crowd that matters.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 2-2-2008(14): I&#039;m the only one that instead of [mangling... powerful] sees [six... メカ]? All muslims should visit the <em>Meca</em> at least once in their lives, and many stop there. So, if anyone has visited the <em>Meca</em> <em>six</em> times, that has<strong> merit</strong>!!
