1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/carnieri">carnieri</a>] 19-7-2006(200): Eating<strong> spicy</strong> food makes you <em>stand up</em> <em>ten</em> times faster than usual, &#039;cause you just need to get something to drink!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 26-10-2006(111): Eating<strong> spicy</strong> food makes you stand up as if you had sat on a needle.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xingji">xingji</a>] 21-4-2008(23): This caracter has 2 meaning :<strong> Spicy</strong> -&gt; see book (からい） and heart-breaking painful （つらい） =&gt; stand up on barefooted on needles is painful.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hujis">Hujis</a>] 26-3-2009(19): After eating really<strong> spicy</strong> food you will probably spend most of the next day <em>stading</em> up because it will feel like you have a <em>needle</em> stuck up your arse. Numbers dont work well for me.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 11-6-2010(5): <strong>Spicy</strong> like drinking a vase full of needles.
