1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 10-12-2005(272): Traditional Japanese storefront<strong> door</strong>s have several <em>flags</em>, known as &quot;noren,&quot; hanging down from a curtain rod in front of them. I see this as a pseudo-pictograph, and use the horizontal line across the top to represent the curtain rod, since noren don&#039;t usually hang from the <em>ceiling</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 30-12-2006(37): A Japanese<strong> door</strong> has a noren, a <em>flag</em> hanging from a <em>rod</em>. (I give this primitive the meaning of a noren-covered<strong> door</strong>).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35">ruuku35</a>] 17-5-2006(25): Their is only ONE FLAG on<strong> DOOR</strong>s in Japan. The Japanese FLAG of course!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/b0ng0">b0ng0</a>] 29-1-2009(17): If you are too poor to afford a<strong> door</strong>, you can just hang a <em>single flag</em> instead.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 14-5-2008(11): I was standing in my bathroom <em>pee</em>ing when there was a loud knock on the<strong> door</strong>. It scared me so badly that I fell backwards and <em>pee</em>d on the <em>ceiling</em>. What can I say, I got some strong <em>pee</em> muscles.. (Note: I use &quot;pee&quot; for the &quot;flag&quot; primitive).
