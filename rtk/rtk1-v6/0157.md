1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gsantise">gsantise</a>] 25-8-2007(175): A<strong> river</strong> CAN exist only if there is WATER.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Avispa">Avispa</a>] 29-8-2007(85): I kept confusing this with <em>stream</em>. My Japanese friend said that to him this is for an artificial<strong> river</strong>. Looking at kanji compounds with this there are two that struck me: One is the Yellow<strong> River</strong> in China ( 黄河 ), and the other is the Milky Way ( 銀河 ). Now I either think of the Little Engine that <em>could</em> dragging a bunch of stuff down a<strong> river</strong> in China and polluting it (so it turned yellow) or I see the Little Engine that Could flying across the sky making the Milky Way.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ningen">Ningen</a>] 26-8-2008(24): The lesson of persistence: even drops of <em>water can</em> become a<strong> RIVER</strong>.
