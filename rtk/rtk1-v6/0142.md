1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brian44">brian44</a>] 28-8-2007(148): Follow the <em>springs</em> down the <em>cliff</em> and you will find a nice<strong> meadow</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LeoOra">LeoOra</a>] 7-2-2008(73): Sorry about this, but Heisig was stupid calling this kanji<strong> meadow</strong>, used in composite words the most common meaning is <strong>ORIGIN</strong>... To remember just think that life may have begun in <em>pound</em>s or <em>spring</em>s in a land with many <em>cliff</em>s ... Just to answer correctly the review lessons think of<strong> meadow</strong> as the <em>origin</em> of a huge forest.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pangolin">Pangolin</a>] 16-4-2009(62): Forget about &quot;spring&quot; because the water primitive is abbreviated to &quot;little&quot;. This is easy to forget by the time you&#039;ve finished RTK1. Instead, imagine standing on an exceedingly high <em>cliff</em>. Not overlooking the sea, but overlooking<strong> meadow</strong>s. And what on earth are those <em>white little</em> things? Wow, they&#039;re sheep! This cliff must be really high!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/findus">findus</a>] 22-10-2007(57): When in a<strong> meadow</strong>, the japanese girls who are <em>white</em> and <em>small</em> search for the shadow of a <em>cliff</em> to avoid taning.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mazel">mazel</a>] 29-8-2007(26): [L2]. Under a CLIFF is a<strong> meadow</strong> with WHITE SMALL flowers.
