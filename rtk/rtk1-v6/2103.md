1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/onsen_monkey">onsen_monkey</a>] 12-9-2006(188): These bugs<strong> BELONG</strong> TO an extremist group promoting insect independence. They are parading the FLAG of their group, the Nationalist GNATS, and wearing explosives BELTS for their planned terrorist war.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Transtic">Transtic</a>] 14-3-2008(133): [WARNING: violent story] Two teams of <strong>insects</strong> are playing “capture the <strong>flag</strong>” (ala Unreal Tournament). All of them wear ammunition <strong>belts</strong>. Here you try to take the <strong>flag</strong> of the opponent team, when you are faced by an <strong>insect</strong>: “You’ll get our <strong>flag</strong> over my dead body!”. You reply: “All your base are<strong> BELONG</strong> to us!”, shoot him on the head, take the <strong>flag</strong> and run away. See the <strong>drop</strong> of blood flowing from his head?

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/noname">noname</a>] 29-6-2008(77): This kanji is often used like this: The frog<strong> BELONG</strong>S to the amphibian species. STORY: A scientist is trying to classify all the different INSECTS in the forest to find out which species they<strong> BELONG</strong> to. He does this by going from rock to rock, tree to tree, putting a FLAG where he already went, while taking INSECT sample DROPS (small insects/beetles look like DROPS) and DROPPING them into his BELT which is rigged with little jars.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fergal">fergal</a>] 25-11-2009(27): Great picture with a story: <a href="http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?pid=64390#p64390">http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?pid=64390#p64390</a>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 11-12-2007(27): &quot;You don&#039;t<strong> BELONG</strong> here!&quot;, cried the crowd to the stranger they tied to the FLAG pole with a BELT as swarms of GNATS ate at his flesh. &quot;You don&#039;t<strong> BELONG</strong> here!&quot; At that moment, the man began to believe them ^_^.
