1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha">Ninjasha</a>] 12-12-2007(136): A<strong> CREEK</strong> is a small trail of <em>water</em> easily <em>craft</em>ed with a stick.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nwatkins">nwatkins</a>] 18-9-2007(83): <strong>Creek</strong>s are small water, easily crossed with a simple i-beam.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/indigo">indigo</a>] 21-12-2007(35): Using <em>water</em> and some <em>craft</em>, one can make a<strong> creek</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry">elktapestry</a>] 15-3-2007(24): This Kanji can carry the meaning of &quot;creek&quot;, &quot;inlet&quot;, or &quot;bay&quot; actually. Although the meaning of inlet and bay seem to pop up for me more than instances of it meaning<strong> creek</strong> (I often question Hesig&#039;s choices of these key words, even if his method does seem to be effective). Still... I guess right now I&#039;m using the image of a witch who practices her &quot;craft&quot; next to a watery<strong> creek</strong> leading into an inlet/bay.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kirihitokiri">kirihitokiri</a>] 9-3-2008(19): It is best to practice operating <em>water</em> <em>craft</em> in a<strong> creek</strong> before going to rivers or the sea...
