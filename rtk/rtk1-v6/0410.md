1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Samchan">Samchan</a>] 4-8-2008(319): Hint: This kanji is NOT <em>soil</em> on top of <em>mend</em>, as Heisig claims - that would duplicate one of the strokes. Instead, it is <em>10</em> on top of <em>mend</em>. So my story is: If you<strong> run</strong> <em>10</em> miles, you will need to <em>mend</em> your socks!
