1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 19-2-2007(117): Mr. T is very<strong> partial</strong> to hentai comic books. I know because he dropped a pile of them when I accidentally bumped into him at the door to kinokuniya!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 25-12-2007(88): <em>Mr. T</em> is <strong>partial</strong> to <em>konbini hentai</em>. He reads them for hours every day after work at his local konbini. (Primitive: <em>KONBINI HENTAI</em>, all the magazines(scrapbooks) by every konbini door in Japan).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 1-1-2007(45): Comic book is a nice idea. It&#039;s a sort of scrapbook that is like a door to a different kind of reality. Person is always<strong> partial</strong> (unfair) on the subject of comic books, because (s)he doesn&#039;t like them.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 16-12-2008(38): Right side: scrapbook on your door = <em>Heisig kanji poster</em>. Story: A <em>person</em> with a <em>Heisig kanji poster</em> is<strong> partial</strong> to the Heisig method.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/noname">noname</a>] 3-3-2008(29): This reminds me of those<strong> PARTIAL</strong>/BIASED religious PEOPLE who come to your DOOR trying to shove the biblical SCRAPBOOK down your throat.
