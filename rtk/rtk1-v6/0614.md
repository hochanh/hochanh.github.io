1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 8-9-2007(409): Microsoft<strong> Outlook</strong> works about as well as a pegasus that can&#039;t see: they both crash all the time.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tummai">tummai</a>] 23-4-2008(100): I used to hate birds.They&#039;re loud, stupid and worst of all they shit on your head. Used to think birds were the most vile creatures on earth. Then I encountered a <em>pegasus</em>. I was just walking down the road, minding my own business when I happened to <em>look</em> up. I <em>saw</em> it there, braying noisily, ivory wings outstretched like an angel, back leg raised ever so slightly. It dropped a steaming brown load right on my face. It changed my<strong> outlook</strong> completely. Birds are the second most vile creatures on earth.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 14-10-2009(64): This kanji actually means <strong>view</strong>. While on a pegasus you will see a great <strong>view</strong>.
