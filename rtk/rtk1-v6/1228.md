1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 3-9-2006(349): The policed<strong> inquire</strong>d into the erotica scandal. They tried to sweep away the evidence, but some of it stuck. (Note: katakana エロ <em>ero</em> in the middle of this kanji is the Japanese word for erotica.).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 20-1-2008(85): As a verb this means, this means &quot;to ask; to enquire; to search; to look for; to look into; to investigate;&quot;. Imagine the police inquiring in an in-depth investigation. They are interrogating a suspect. But the suspect has a <em>crafty mouth</em> and is very sly. He/she also knows when to keep their mouth shut(<em>glued</em>) at the right moments to avoid self-incrimination. As a final measure, the police torture the suspect by tickling him/her with a broom while they<strong> inquire</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/netsplitter">netsplitter</a>] 15-12-2008(68): You are new in Japan and you<strong> inquire</strong> about a new job. Lucky for you, there is one. You&#039;re now the guy with the <em>broom</em> who sweeps the <em>エロ (ero)</em> &quot;studio&quot; after they&#039;re done. &quot;Eww, what&#039;s this <em>gluing</em> the <em>broom</em> to the ground...&quot;. Time to<strong> inquire</strong> about a new job :).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/melchan">melchan</a>] 14-6-2009(34): The cleaning lady found some <em>エロ ero</em> pictures <em>glued</em> together while sweeping the floor and started to<strong> inquire</strong> everyone around about it.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taijuando">taijuando</a>] 22-5-2006(21): I tried to<strong> inquire</strong> about <em>broom</em> <em>craft</em> but every one&#039;s <em>mouth</em> was <em>glued</em> under an<strong> inquire</strong> spell.
