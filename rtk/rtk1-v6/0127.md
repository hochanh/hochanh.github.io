1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps">ceeeps</a>] 2-9-2007(184): Imagine four hungry <em>mouths</em> all sitting around the table. They are all banging their <strong>utensils</strong> on the table waiting for a <em>big</em> meal to be placed in the centre.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NooNoo">NooNoo</a>] 16-4-2008(53): Note: 器 by itself means <strong>container/caliber/vessel</strong>. And 食器 means eating<strong> utensil</strong>s (&quot;food container&quot;, hehe).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe">stereovibe</a>] 26-2-2008(39): Four <em>mouths</em> sit at the four corners of the table, waiting for their<strong> utensil</strong>s, ready to devour the large, spread eagled St. Bernard stretched out on the table!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lee101">lee101</a>] 28-7-2011(25): I swear RevTK has got too politically correct, I mean people on here are copying Heisig&#039;s original story only shortening it which is fine, yet they are getting dislikes, only due to the fact its about eating a dog!? Other instances include where people make slight reference to sex, race, violence - Heisig clearly states that it&#039;s fine to do this. (part 1, part two on the next frame).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/squirrelscuba">squirrelscuba</a>] 14-5-2010(13): Four jgirl&#039;s mouths surrounding my large<strong> utensil</strong>.
