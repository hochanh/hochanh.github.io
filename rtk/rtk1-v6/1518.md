1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 7-3-2007(65): It&#039;s a<strong> widespread</strong> belief that they cannot find <em>fingerprints</em> on a body that has been deposited in the <em>water</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 23-7-2009(37): It&#039;s a<strong> widespread</strong> belief that <em>water</em> takes away <em>fingerprints</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 6-3-2010(14): To foil 犯人 , the use of <em>watermarks (water + fingerprint)</em> on banknotes is<strong> widespread</strong>. 氾 foils 犯 .

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stupiddog">stupiddog</a>] 27-12-2011(7): Warning: 氾濫 (flood) seems to be the only compound known to the WWWJDIC, so I propose this as an alternative keyword. The burglars <em>flooded</em> the mansion they broke into with <em>water</em>, thus leaving no <em>fingerprints</em> behind.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/billyclyde">billyclyde</a>] 29-10-2007(5): <strong>Widespread</strong> panic arises when they discover the WATER has FINGERPRINTS all over it-- water thieves! And now,<strong> widespread</strong> water shortages.
