1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/erikkusan">erikkusan</a>] 16-3-2006(226): This clock<strong> include</strong>s a mouth that will tell you what the time is now. Hearing impaired people have this kind of watches... now imagine them as a big mouth under the clock.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak">wrightak</a>] 27-6-2006(89): Batteries<strong> include</strong>d with this <em>clock</em>. Open the <em>mouth</em> at the back and insert them after purchase.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/woodwojr">woodwojr</a>] 24-2-2010(78): #include &lt; <em>time</em>.h &gt;, &lt; <em>stdio</em>.h &gt;//or <em>clock</em>.h , <em>mouth</em>.h.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 11-4-2007(39): (Based on erikkusan&#039;s story) For today&#039;s urban professionals -- who are so busy that they don&#039;t even have time to look at their watch -- this <em>clock</em><strong> include</strong>s a <em>mouth</em> that will announce the time. Picture the clock; it&#039;s in the shape of a face, so the mouth is at the bottom. That should keep it distinct from <a href="../v4/1589.html">versify</a> (#1589 吟).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TheSlakey">TheSlakey</a>] 3-1-2009(19): If you want to be<strong> include</strong>d in the gang, NOW is the time to open your MOUTH and say so.
