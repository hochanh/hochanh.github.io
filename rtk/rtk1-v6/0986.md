1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak">wrightak</a>] 31-3-2009(51): The keyword<strong> numb</strong> makes no sense. I choose 萎む （しぼむ）&quot;<strong>to fade away</strong>&quot;. A <em>girl</em> lies in a <em>wheat</em> field at the same time every day. A photo is taken every day showing this scene and a time lapse video shows the wheat growing through the year until the wheat is tall and the top sprouts to look like its <em>flowers</em>. At this point, the girl can no longer be seen in the photos and she <strong>fades away</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 22-1-2009(35): Any FLOWER that will make you go<strong> NUMB</strong> is likely to be banned by the olympic COMMITTEE. No pain killers.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 18-6-2007(20): Oh, the <em>committee</em>&#039;s in for a surprise: I put some <em>nightshades</em> into their drinks. They&#039;ll be<strong> numb</strong> for sure, probably worse.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hissatsu">hissatsu</a>] 18-11-2010(19): As the <em>flower committee</em> meeting went on and on, my mind went<strong> numb</strong> and everything <strong>faded away</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 27-4-2010(12): &quot;<strong>fade away</strong>&quot; 萎む （しぼむ）seems a more suitable keyword. [thanks wrightak] To link both words:<strong> Numb</strong>ness is when &quot;sensations fade away&quot;. STORY: The <em>committee</em> meeting was so long and boring, some participants took an opium <em>flower</em> tisane allowing the proceedings to <strong>fade away</strong>, swopping boredom for<strong> numb</strong>ness.
