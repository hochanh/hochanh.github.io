1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 7-5-2006(146): The most unlikely persons in the world to take up<strong> agriculture</strong> must be Bender and Bruce Lee. An awkwared moment as they stare on the various farming utensils, hoe, plow. Both with straw hats on and blue overalls, and drawn in Groenigs irrevent style.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/greenapple">greenapple</a>] 22-5-2006(99): Bruce Lee is tough. But so is agricultural work. If Bruce took it up, even he would hurt his back from all the bending.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DavidZ">DavidZ</a>] 12-12-2009(29): (combine Immacolata &amp; mattimus:) The most unlikely duo to take up<strong> agriculture</strong> must be <em>Bender</em> and <em>Bruce Lee</em>. An awkward moment ensues as they stand in straw hats and overalls, staring at the various farm implements. But soon Bruce Lee is spinning Bender above his head while Bender&#039;s arms and legs perform all sorts of <strong>agricultural</strong> tasks like pruning, watering, sowing... 農業 [のうぎょう] <a href="midori://search?text=、農場">、農場</a> [のうじょう].

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 20-4-2008(22): It&#039;s a good <strong>agricultural</strong> sign when, as the farmer is <em>bending</em> down, he discovers some plants arranged in the <em>sign of the dragon</em>. It means the weather and earth will be supportive of the crops.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 6-10-2008(10): <em>Bruce Lee</em> developed a <em>bend</em> in his back from doing<strong> agriculture</strong>.
