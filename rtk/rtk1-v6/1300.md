1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 15-2-2008(167): Just one <em>drop</em> (of alcohol) and he starts walking in <em>zig-zags</em> – no wonder <em>Zorro</em>&#039;s living in<strong> destitution</strong>. (Note: As a primitive let 之 be <em>Zorro</em> or <em>Zig-Zag</em>: it&#039;s pictographic).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 22-2-2006(132): Children in complete<strong> destitution</strong> have no hope of ever getting toys to play with, so when they find even a tiny <em>drop</em> of a <em>building block</em> they are overjoyed.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 31-1-2008(54): The people living in<strong> destitution</strong> POOR. Zorro gives them every drop he has: drops of sweat while fighting, drops of blood when he is cut down,... even the senorita gets some drops.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 20-5-2008(24): <em>Zorro</em> helps prostitutes living in<strong> destitution</strong>. He gives them money, in return they allow him to cover them in <em>drops of Zorro</em>. What a philanthropist! (thanks filip!).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/digicult">digicult</a>] 15-6-2009(12): This is bad story, but whatever, it works, I was having real trouble with this kanji: On those Sunday morning World Vision shows you see African children living in total<strong> destitution</strong>, often wearing some wacky T-shirt that was popular in the West back in the 80&#039;s or something. Now see one little <strong>destitute</strong> child wearing a T-shirt that reads &quot;A Drop of Zorro.&quot; A <em>Drop of Zorro</em>? What the hell? I don&#039;t remember that movie!
