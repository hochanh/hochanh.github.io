1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 13-2-2006(248): A merry-go-round with a big <em>banner</em> on top and below a veritable zoo of bakelite animals on poles in perpertual<strong> rotation</strong> accompanied by silly music. Giraffes, elephants, zebras, rhinos...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 25-10-2007(135): Don&#039;t confuse with revolve or axis! Think of<strong> rotation</strong> as a<strong> rotation</strong> of animals in the <em>zoo</em> - some are on display (in<strong> rotation</strong>), some are in cages in the back (out of<strong> rotation</strong>). The ones currently in<strong> rotation</strong> (on display) are advertised with a large <em>banner</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bennyb">bennyb</a>] 3-6-2009(38): I had trouble remember this with previous zoo-banner-rotation stories, so here is something a bit more vivid: The future of ZOO technology: There is a giant Ferris Wheel-type contraption with individual plastic cages, each with an animal that ROTATES every 10 minutes. It&#039;s built half-way into the ground, can you envision it? The lazy people who watch wouldn&#039;t know what animal was what without the colorful BANNERS that accompany each cage.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 17-12-2008(17): The zoo is now open and the electric BANNER that says &quot;ZOO&quot; is in full<strong> rotation</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CarolinaCG">CarolinaCG</a>] 7-8-2009(6): The zoo banner rotates.
