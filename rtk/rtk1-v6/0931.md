1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 10-11-2007(296): <em>10,000</em> Persians are at the base of the <em>cliff</em>, but the leader of the 300 Spartans just flexes his huge <em>muscles</em> and<strong> encourage</strong>s his men by shouting that they have the <em>power</em> to fight them all.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 21-7-2007(71): People<strong> encourage</strong> you, giving you the power so you can dive off the 10,000m high cliff into the sea.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 13-2-2008(56): See the most-starred story in <a href="../v4/514.html">horse chestnut</a> (#514 栃) for an easy way to remember this one. --&gt; That same famous <em>cliffside</em> in Japan at which <em>10,000</em> people died ... together, we have the <em>power</em> to do something about it ... let&#039;s<strong> encourage</strong> the government to take action!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eltjopoort">eltjopoort</a>] 8-6-2008(54): <em>10,000</em> lemmings, an invisible <em>power</em> seems to be encouraging them to dive off the <em>cliff</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yukkuri_kame">yukkuri_kame</a>] 9-4-2009(33): All of you on this site<strong> encourage</strong> me so much. Japanese no longer seems like an impossible cliff 10,000 meters high. Thanks to the<strong> encourage</strong>ment I&#039;ve gotten here, I have the POWER to learn 10,000 Kanji!
