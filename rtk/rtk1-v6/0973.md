5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stupiddog">stupiddog</a>] 8-8-2009(41): Japanese pears (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrus_pyrifolia">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrus_pyrifolia</a>) are very tasty fruits and frequently used as a gift in Japan. They are quite expensive, so you can assume that a farmer can make a good <em>profit</em> from these fruits after getting them from the <em>tree</em>.
