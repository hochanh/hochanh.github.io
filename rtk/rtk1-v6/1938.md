1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 29-6-2007(82): At <em>Thanksgiving</em>, it’s <em>uncommon</em> for people to<strong> accept humbly</strong> the food: most people just dig in.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 14-8-2008(31): You&#039;re invited to a <em>Thanksgiving</em> party in Japan! Awesome! You&#039;re so happy that your Japanese friends are trying to make you feel at home (you&#039;ve been homesick recently). You sit down to the table, and they bring out some..uh...<em>uncommon</em> food. Really <em>uncommon</em>. Like just imagine the most <em>uncommon</em> <em>Thanksgiving</em> food ever, and that&#039;s what you&#039;re given (i don&#039;t know, a frisbee or something?). Of course, you have to be Japanese and<strong> accept humbly</strong> their food.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yozora">Yozora</a>] 9-9-2009(11): As THANKSGIVING is an American holiday, it is UNCOMMON to say いただきます! before eating.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 30-4-2010(9): &quot;<strong>ACCEPT HUMBLY</strong>&quot; is a translation for 頂戴する (chōdai-suru), a Japanese expression of <em>THANKS-GIVING</em> that shows an <em>UNCOMMON</em> degree of respect and formality, and is reserved for the most <em>UNCOMMONl</em>y solemn occasions. Ironically, 戴 also appears in 戴きます (いただきます), which is also a form of <em>THANKS-GIVING</em>, but is <em>anything but UNCOMMON</em>. In fact, it is so commonplace to that it borders on formulaic and meaningless. (NB: いただきます is also written 頂きます ).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Puchatek">Puchatek</a>] 11-8-2011(2): During <em>Thanksgiving</em> it is <em>uncommon</em> to see Americans<strong> accept humbly</strong> their meal. Usually they&#039;re more like &quot;Turkeyyy!!! Give me my turkeeeey, bitch!&quot;.
