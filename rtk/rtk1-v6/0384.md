1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nilfisq">nilfisq</a>] 14-8-2007(189): The <em>gay parade</em> looks astonishing, as if<strong> overgrown</strong> with <em>flowers</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 29-8-2007(108): When your garden gets<strong> OVERGROWN</strong>, it&#039;s like the plants are mocking you. Here, you can see the roses actually parading around the yard, wilfully choking out the other, more docile plants. Then they actually go and parade down the street!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Francois">Francois</a>] 11-3-2008(90): At the flower parade, (hippies&#039; parade) all I can see is walking masses of<strong> overgrown</strong> hair!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 3-1-2010(40): It&#039;s important that the word<strong> overgrown</strong> leads to the elements, rather than have the elements lead to<strong> overgrown</strong> as I see too often in the other examples. So I turned one of the other stories around. STORY:<strong> OVERGROWN</strong> hair appears the most in a <em>FLOWER</em> power <em>PARADE</em> (of the hippies in the late 60&#039;s).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stephan">stephan</a>] 3-10-2008(28): I use <em>scythe</em> as a primitive instead of <em>parade</em>. A <em>scythe</em> is like a <em>spear</em> (see [356]) whose tip has been bent to use for scything. When <em>flowers</em> have<strong> overgrown</strong> your front yard, use a <em>scythe</em> to cut them!
