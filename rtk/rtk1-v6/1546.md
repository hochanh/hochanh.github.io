1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/greenapple">greenapple</a>] 28-8-2006(151): The<strong> waver</strong> for this kanji means to hesitate. I<strong> waver</strong>ed before going into the bar with a bunch of horned wild dogs drinking whiskey straight out of the bottle.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shakkun">shakkun</a>] 17-6-2008(83): For the right primitive: Red Bull (the energy drink). Can be mixed with alcohol and gives you wi- uh, horns. Coincidentally, also the name of the Indian CHIEFTAN in frame 2906. (Thanks Katsuo).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 26-8-2008(81): Tip: <em>horns</em> + <em>whiskey bottle</em> : This combination of primitives appears five times in Heisig, including as a separate kanji 酋 <a href="../v4/2906.html">chieftain</a> (#2906 酋). REF: <a href="../v4/1439.html">revered</a> (#1439 尊), <a href="../v4/2425.html">courtesy</a> (#2425 鄭), <a href="../v4/2493.html">Japanese oak</a> (#2493 楢). Edit: Note that in some fonts <em>horns</em> are replaced by <em>eight</em> 八 .

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wakela">Wakela</a>] 11-9-2007(80): . Have you ever had Wild Dog brand whiskey? That stuff is downright evil. So evil, the bottle has horns, and you need to sign a<strong> waver</strong> before you drink it. Because of this warning you will surely<strong> waver</strong> as you bring the shot glass to your lips.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bladethecoder">bladethecoder</a>] 2-6-2010(34): I<strong> waver</strong>ed when the <em>pack of wild dogs</em> was blocking the way, but then I drank some <em>Red Bull</em> and charged through. (thanks shakkun).
