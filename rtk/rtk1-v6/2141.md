1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 19-4-2007(219): You stand in AWE at the 8th<strong> WONDER</strong> of the world, a huge TROJAN HORSE.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 16-9-2009(79): This is another word for surprise. <a href="midori://search?text=驚く＝おどろく">驚く＝おどろく</a> = surprise. The Trojans stood in <em>awe</em> of the magnificent Trojan Horse that they thought was a gift. But imagine their <strong>surprise (wonder)</strong> when a bunch of Greeks came rushing out of it! (To further cement the connection between the primitives, if needed: It&#039;s a<strong> wonder</strong> that the Trojans managed to speak <em>keigo</em> 敬語 even then, saying &quot; わたくしたちを殺さないでください !! お願い致します !!&quot;).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/genbaku">genbaku</a>] 23-1-2008(28): The horse<strong> wonder</strong>s why it is being addressed in keigo 敬語 after all it is only a horse.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 7-1-2007(15): A lowly farmer is staring in<strong> wonder</strong> at a prince and a team of horses who has appeared before him, and uses the flowery phrases beaten into him by a taskmaster ( 敬語 , honorifics) to avoid being beheaded for rudeness.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 7-4-2009(14): I stood in <em>awe</em> as<strong> Wonder</strong> Woman revealed that she was hung like a <em>horse</em>.
