1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(172): The slave reclines on the floor at night to watch the stars. Since that&#039;s the only thing the slave is allowed to “read”, he does so very thoroughly and diligently, hence<strong> perusal</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 5-9-2007(104): [+scottamus] &quot;Please, come in and <strong>peruse</strong> this fine selection of slaves, all reclining here on the floor for your<strong> perusal</strong>. Have a look here&quot;: <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Slave_ship_diagram.png/440px-Slave_ship_diagram.png">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Slave_ship_diagram.png/440px-Slave_ship_diagram.png</a>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus">scottamus</a>] 6-12-2005(90): &quot;Please come in and make a<strong> perusal</strong> of all my finest <em>slaves</em> <em>laying</em> on the <em>floor</em>. Tell me if you <em>see</em> anyone you like. For you, I make the best deal.&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bexinkyushu">bexinkyushu</a>] 25-7-2011(60): In Japan while out shopping, you will often hear the shop assistant use the phrase &#039; ご覧ください &#039; (goran kudasai) which are words to the effect of &#039;please feel free to browse/take a look&#039;. It is a politer way of asking someone to look than &#039; 見て &#039; (mite). In the kanji for<strong> perusal</strong>, we have <em>see</em>, but also the addition of the Japanese sales assistant who acts as your personal <em>slave</em> with their body always <em>inclined</em> to the <em>floor</em> in a bow, marking the more respectful nuance of this kanji..

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pm215">pm215</a>] 25-3-2008(26): [var of noname&#039;s story] This kanji is used for the keigo ご覧になる . A <em>slave</em> comes up to his master who is <em>reclining</em> on the <em>floor</em> while his mistresses keep him cool with big leaves. The slave holds a document that has just been completed. As a slave talking to a master, he doesn&#039;t just say &quot;you wanted to <em>see</em> this&quot; but &quot;the document is ready for your<strong> perusal</strong>&quot;. In Japanese, he would use &quot; ご覧になる .&quot;.
