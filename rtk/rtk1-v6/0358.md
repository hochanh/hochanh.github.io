1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nilfisq">nilfisq</a>] 13-8-2007(232): To<strong> admonish</strong> is to enforce <em>awe</em> by means of <em>words</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cheechuan">cheechuan</a>] 22-11-2007(105): Watch in <em>awe</em> as mom<strong> admonish</strong>es the rude clerk with <em>words</em> that you&#039;ve never heard her use before.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/caeliean">caeliean</a>] 10-7-2008(82): Japanese police officers prefer to<strong> admonish</strong> perpetrators by <em>awe</em>ing them with their <em>words</em>. You&#039;ve never had a talking down to, until you&#039;ve been a Japanese high school student caught littering in a small Japanese town. Just imagine the talking to that kid would get! Incidentally, this kanji is the first kanji in the word for police.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DavidZ">DavidZ</a>] 12-10-2009(27): I will now<strong> admonish</strong> every person here who used WORD as a keyword in this story. There is no WORD ( 語 ) in this kanji! I know Heisig himself teaches it that way. Doesn&#039;t make it right, does it? This is about <em>SAY</em>ing something that inspires <em>AWE</em>. You will regret it when you get to <a href="../v4/347.html">word</a> (#347 語)! ;)... 警察 [けいさつ] <a href="midori://search?text=、警告">、警告</a> [けいこく] warning.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 29-8-2007(16): To<strong> ADMONISH</strong> is to simply <em>say&amp; a lot of </em>awe*ful words (excuse the liberties taken with spelling).
