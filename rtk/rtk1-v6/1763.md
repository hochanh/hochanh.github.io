1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 20-9-2006(190): <strong>Sad</strong>dness is like having your <em>heart</em> captured and <em>jailed</em> because of some<strong> sad</strong> or terrible event, etc. Here the<strong> sad</strong> <em>heart</em> waits for someone to come and <em>un</em>-lock their <em>jail cell</em> and set them free again.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 21-8-2006(74): Stuck in a <em>jail cell</em> with his <em>heart</em> crying out to see his family again, the prisoner has never felt so<strong> sad</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 9-7-2007(48): A <em>jail cell</em> will make any <em>heart</em><strong> sad</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcbainpc">mcbainpc</a>] 19-8-2008(24): For some reason, this kanji makes me think of some Toni Braxton song, but I change the lyrics to &quot;Un-<em>jail</em> my <em>heart</em>&quot;. Now that mnemonic has stuck in my head.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 23-12-2008(9): Imagine the<strong> sad</strong> image of a prisoner in a <em>jail cell</em> feeling<strong> sad</strong> as he looks at all the little <em>hearts</em> his daughter used to draw for him when she was just a child. Now she wants nothing to do with him.
