1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 27-5-2007(287): A <em>military officer</em> must offer<strong> consolation</strong> to the <em>hearts</em> of the families of his fallen men.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RobMow">RobMow</a>] 8-9-2008(107): This Kanji appears in the word 慰安婦 いあんふ, which was what the infamous WW II &quot;comfort women&quot; were called in Japanese. The story goes something like this: As a way of providing<strong> consolation</strong> to battle-weary, <em>heartsick military officers and soldiers</em>, the Japanese set up comfort stations (brothels) for their servicemen. (Just to be clear: this is not an endorsement of the practice, just a way to remember the Kanji.).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shakkun">shakkun</a>] 14-6-2008(39): The MILITARY OFFICER is given a Purple HEART by the army as<strong> consolation</strong> for the wounds he received in the line of duty.

But, as a<strong> consolation</strong> prize, you get his <em>heart</em>!&quot; TA-DAAA!! &quot;Thanks for playing, folks!&quot; (cue screaming).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 17-12-2007(12): &quot;My time in the army was complete misery.&quot; - &quot;Well if it&#039;s any<strong> consolation</strong> that bastard <em>military officer</em> had a <em>heart</em> attack.&quot;.
