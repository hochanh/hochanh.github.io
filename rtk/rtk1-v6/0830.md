1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/the40pancakes">the40pancakes</a>] 14-4-2009(108): YOU CAN&#039;T POSSIBLY NEED A MNEMONIC FOR THIS!!!!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(67): Pictograph, see book. * As a primitive this element appears equally as well at the top or bottom of the kanjis (besides appearing to the left). Since a<strong> mountain</strong> often brings to mind towering peaks, I will consider it implied that the element is placed at the top of the kanji. When this primitive appears at the bottom, I will arrange my story in a way that other elements are said to be at the very top of the<strong> mountain</strong> (see FRAME 775 for an example).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 9-10-2008(7): I wouldn&#039;t have thrown my <em>walking stick</em> in the <em>trash bin</em> if I&#039;d known I&#039;d be climbing a<strong> mountain</strong>!
