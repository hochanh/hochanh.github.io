1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 24-4-2007(235): To print something with bountiful colour, they use<strong> glossy</strong> paper.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 25-3-2010(37): If you go to have photo’s printed, you may be asked if you would like a matted or<strong> GLOSSY</strong> finish. For nature shots, with BOUNTIFUL COLORS, I would recommend going with<strong> GLOSSY</strong> paper.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 29-12-2006(10): Similar to the previous frame. The<strong> glossy</strong> pages of many magazines are bountiful in &quot;color&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yLaguardia">yLaguardia</a>] 4-7-2012(5): This a special edition of a comic book about the adventures of BENDER and Mr. BEAN (check sindikhara story on <a href="../v4/1443.html">bountiful</a> (#1443 豊) to see one of the adventures). It would normally be black and white on cheap paper, but being this one a special edition, it was printed COLORED on<strong> GLOSSY</strong> paper and BOUND UP in hard cover.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 2-3-2008(4): Bender thinks he is filthy rich with all his beans. He wont get away from it. Finally they found a way. The spray Bender and his beans with <strong>glossy(smooth and shiny)</strong> colours. Now Bender runs of an tries to find a way to get his manly, rusty colour back.
