2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joesan">joesan</a>] 6-10-2007(131): One of the first thing a baby can do with his hand is to <em>reach out</em> and grab your <em>finger</em> as if it was a little<strong> handle</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paddy71">paddy71</a>] 7-2-2008(60): <strong>Handle</strong> with care... carefully hold the Nitroglycerin within your fingers with outstretched hands for fear of it blowing up in your face...

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomtosh">tomtosh</a>] 22-6-2009(42): Pay attention to this story because you&#039;ll learn how to recall the reading of this kanji as well: We&#039;ve all heard the expression: &quot;Too hot to<strong> handle</strong>&quot; -- Well, just imagine you are <em>reaching out</em> your <em>fingers</em> to touch someone&#039;s face and it is too hot to<strong> handle</strong>. (Then you can combine the word for hot (atsui) with the word for face (kao) and always remember how this character is read: atsukau - あつかう.).
