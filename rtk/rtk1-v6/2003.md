1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 25-8-2007(268): This is a military-<strong>grade</strong> <em>staple gun</em>! It can be loaded with real <em>missiles</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thunderball">Thunderball</a>] 24-9-2007(50): In order to get your 1st<strong> grade</strong>, or first-dan (だん) black belt, you have to learn hand to hand combat with new weapons - first the grapple involving the <em>staple gun</em>, and then the <em>missile</em> deployment technique.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nuriko">Nuriko</a>] 8-4-2008(39): Imagine a really mean teacher who<strong> grade</strong>s papers with a staple-gun that shoots out staples (in a missile-like fashion) onto the paper to form the letter &quot;F&quot;. She even uses such an opportunity as target practice. She gets way over to the other end of the class and shoots the little &quot;staple missiles&quot; onto the paper, cackling all the while.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 6-3-2008(26): When you are first dan, your punches hurt like a staple gun. When you are 10th dan, like a missile. So 1st<strong> grade</strong> is staple gun, 10th<strong> grade</strong> is missile. OR The first dan fellas are training with staplers. The 10th dan are whirling around rocket launchers (trick is not to set it off when you are doing all kind of fancy tricks. That is why there are so few 10 dans).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jasta">Jasta</a>] 10-1-2009(9): First<strong> grade</strong>rs in the army can use <em>staple guns</em>. Only when you are of high rank can you fire a <em>missile</em>.
