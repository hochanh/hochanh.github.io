1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 14-9-2007(197): Both a meter and a yard are about one arm-length.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samesong">samesong</a>] 29-8-2008(67): When girls ask about my<strong> length</strong>, I hold out my <em>one arm</em>, and tell them &quot;you get the idea&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skinnyneo">skinnyneo</a>] 15-4-2008(57): This kanji reminds me of the kanji for big (I think it looks the same kinda of except for the last stroke). Maybe this works for guys, but when you were growing up you would compare &quot;length&quot; with your friends trying to show how BIG you were. You wouldn&#039;t show &quot;it&quot; but you would spread your arms out as wide as possible to exaggerate your<strong> length</strong>. Maybe even so wide that you trip (I the 3rd stroke getting pushed over)! I just find it easier to relate this to the previous kanji.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fragileshards">fragileshards</a>] 29-11-2007(37): This kanji demonstrates the proper technique for throwing a bowling ball the<strong> LENGTH</strong> of the alley. Stroke 1- lift the ball up horizontally to judge the throw Stroke 2 - gently swing the arm back Stroke 3 - whip your arm forward and roll the ball off the tips of your fingers Strike!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fruitangel">fruitangel</a>] 4-1-2009(23): ONE ARM<strong> LENGTH</strong>.
