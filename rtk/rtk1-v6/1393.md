2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Soseki">Soseki</a>] 27-2-2008(65): The <em>pinnacle</em> of racism was that of the Nazis. They made the Jews wear a <em>badge</em> on their clothes to identify them. They <strong>hindered</strong> their every movement. Moreover the peace-loving Dutch all wore the <em>badges</em> so that the Jews would be unidentifiable. Effectively <strong>hindering</strong> the Nazi plot.
