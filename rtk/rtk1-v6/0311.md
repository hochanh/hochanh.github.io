1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/penne">penne</a>] 16-3-2008(260): Son, I&#039;ve never told you this but<strong> each</strong> woman has a second <em>mouth</em> between their fiiiiiine <em>walking legs</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johanvg">johanvg</a>] 18-7-2006(156): <strong>Each</strong> and every one of us walks and talks differently.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/miki76">miki76</a>] 15-12-2008(87): <strong>Each</strong> person is gifted with a <em>mouth</em> to get us into trouble and a pair of <em>walking legs</em> to get us out!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zareon">Zareon</a>] 12-2-2007(67): It&#039;s easier for me to remember a concrete object. This combination occurs often enough for me to make it a primitive element. Walking legs and mouth combine to give a &quot;walky talky&quot; or mobile phone. Imagine one of those old big ones which looked like refridgerators. Mobile phones are so popular that<strong> each</strong> of us seems to want one.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha">Ninjasha</a>] 6-2-2008(39): <strong>EACH</strong> of us learns first to use our <em>legs to walk</em> and then to use our <em>mouths</em> to talk.
