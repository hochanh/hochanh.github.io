1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry">elktapestry</a>] 27-3-2007(142): It&#039;s funny, Hesig gives no Kanji in his book that means cheap/inexpensive... well... if you were wondering what Kanji would carry that meaning, look no further. Sometimes I wonder if Hesig just thinks our little brains would be too easily confused by multiple meanings. Regardless, think of that woman<strong> relax</strong>ing. Cheapest place to do that is in one&#039;s own home rather than at some fancy resort, eh? <a href="midori://search?text=家で休暇を取るは安いですね。">家で休暇を取るは安いですね。</a> .

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/enerccio">enerccio</a>] 22-7-2007(83): You can only<strong> relax</strong>, when you have woman under roof to do all chores.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Po0py">Po0py</a>] 20-12-2008(65): Cheapest place for a woman to<strong> relax</strong> is in her own home.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal">captal</a>] 22-3-2008(31): To me, this kanji has always meant &quot;cheap/inexpensive.&quot; The way to remember this kanji is: A woman under a roof is cheap, because she isn&#039;t off spending your money! Now you&#039;ll never forget it!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mhheie">mhheie</a>] 21-1-2008(22): No one who has ever been to Japan could have failed to notice the<strong> relax</strong>ed life of the housewifes. While the husband slaves 14 hours a day at work, the <em>woman</em> of the <em>house</em> meets up with friends in cafes, takes piano lessons, goes shopping (no wonder Heizig didn&#039;t want to use <strong>cheap</strong> as keyword), watch TV dramas...oh, and take care of their 1.2 (and going down) children. A <em>woman</em> in a <em>house</em> is the perfect symbol for <em>relax</em>.
