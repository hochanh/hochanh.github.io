1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bigloui">bigloui</a>] 2-2-2006(164): The <em>march</em> of <em>women</em> - against <em>intimidation</em> in the workplace - is pretty <em>intimidating</em> in itself!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 10-12-2007(64): Interesting that this kanji also has the meanings of &quot;dignity&quot; and &quot;threaten.&quot; I can see how a <em>march</em> of <em>women</em> in Japan would be seen as <em>intimidating</em> by most men.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nekesu04">Nekesu04</a>] 12-11-2008(52): A <em>one woman</em> <em>parade</em>? How is that supposed to<strong> intimidate</strong> me?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stephan">stephan</a>] 3-10-2008(27): I use <em>Grim Reaper</em> instead of <em>march</em> for the primitive, because he&#039;s the <em>one</em> holding the <em>scythe</em> (see [360]). Now imagine a female Grim Reaper - that&#039;s even more <strong>intimidating</strong>!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kaeru">kaeru</a>] 31-10-2008(25): A group of feminist WOMEN are MARCHING for their rights, theyre so ugly it&#039;s INTIMIDATING.
