1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 20-12-2008(142): The kanji looks like an elephant with<strong> tusk</strong>s. the box is the elephant&#039;s eye. The final stroke is the<strong> tusk</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Copycatken">Copycatken</a>] 2-7-2006(87): He stored the<strong> tusk</strong>s into a <em>box</em>, along with the <em>broken halberds</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stupiddog">stupiddog</a>] 28-12-2009(26): You can save yourself a lot of trouble because Heisig is correct on <a href="../v4/1904.html">tusk</a> (#1904 牙) (4), <a href="../v4/1905.html">bud</a> (#1905 芽) (8), <a href="../v4/1906.html">wicked</a> (#1906 邪) (8) but not <a href="../v4/1907.html">gracious</a> (#1907 雅) (5th edition says 12, but WWWJDIC says 13). So: In it&#039;s Kanji form, it has four (4) strokes, in it&#039;s primitive form (I suggest: ivory because that&#039;s what elephant<strong> tusk</strong>s are made of) it has always five (5) strokes for all Kanji in RTK1.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 3-3-2008(21): The <em>waitress</em> was charged by the elephant who skewered her legs with its<strong> tusk</strong>s. As a result her right leg had to be amputated (<em>missing right leg</em>), her left leg is crippled, stiff, and limp (<em>straight left leg</em>), and the<strong> tusk</strong> is still embedded in her left leg (<em>final stroke attached to waitress&#039;s crippled left leg</em>).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 10-6-2007(13): This actually reminds me of <em>waitress</em> more than anything, but that doesn&#039;t help much.
