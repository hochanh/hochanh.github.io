1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 10-5-2007(140): Well, there are weekdays <a href="../v4/576.html">weekday</a> (#576 曜) and there are laundry days <a href="../v4/577.html">laundry</a> (#577 濯), and on February 29th<strong> leap</strong> day, the manufacturer recommends servicing or replacing your <em>peg leg</em> because they tend to wear out every 4 years.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pm215">pm215</a>] 19-4-2008(120): [Story for people following katsuo in making feathers+turkey a &#039;futon&#039; primitive] If you&#039;re going to <strong>leap</strong> from a high place, better hope there&#039;s a <em>futon</em> below -- otherwise you&#039;re going to break your <em>leg</em> at the very least...

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 31-8-2010(80): Tip: <em>feathers</em> + <em>turkey</em> : This combination of primitives appears six times in Heisig, so it&#039;s worthwhile giving it a name. I suggest &quot;<em>futon</em>&quot; (your <em>futon</em> is made from <em>turkey feathers</em>). REF: <a href="../v4/576.html">weekday</a> (#576 曜) , <a href="../v4/577.html">laundry</a> (#577 濯), <em>leap</em> (FRAME 1285), <a href="../v4/2272.html">outstanding</a> (#2272 擢), <a href="../v4/2534.html">twinkle</a> (#2534 燿), <a href="../v4/2880.html">shimmering</a> (#2880 耀). Story: I<strong> leap</strong> out of bed so fast that my <em>wooden leg</em> gets left behind in the <em>futon</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/marydj">marydj</a>] 2-11-2007(41): The <em>turkey</em> with a <em>peg leg</em> is trying to<strong> leap</strong> across the canyon. He flaps his wings wildly and <em>feathers </em> fly but he doesn&#039;t make it.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 20-12-2006(30): I&#039;ve always imagined a<strong> leap</strong> involving one leg instead of two, which would be a jump. Using your only good <em>leg</em> for propulsion, not the <em>pegleg</em>, you try to<strong> leap</strong> over the canyon. Even with the aid of <em>feathers</em>, you fly like a <em>turkey</em> and fall like stone. This is very Roadrunneresque.
