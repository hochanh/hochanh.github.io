1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/guidedog">guidedog</a>] 3-3-2007(160): After a row husbands take their wives upsides down over the knee and<strong> slap</strong> them with their fingers on the bottom (if that doesn&#039;t get me banned…).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 21-5-2006(140): Here we have badly behaving HUSBANDs, whose wives have had them hung UPSIDE DOWN IN A ROW. Each wife approaches her HUSBAND, berates him, gives him a sharp<strong> SLAP</strong> in the face and, Three-Stooges style, pokes him in the eyes with her FINGERS.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 9-12-2006(46): A couple in a rowboat. The wife<strong> slap</strong>s the <em>husband</em> so hard with her <em>fingers</em> that the entire <em>boat</em> flips <em>upside-down</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 12-3-2009(11): I&#039;m the <em>husband</em>. I told my wife to lay <em>upside down</em> so I could have an easier time <em>fingering</em> her. Needless to say, I got a<strong> slap</strong> in the face.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 11-1-2009(9): The wife immediately regretted giving her <em>Berserker husband</em> the <em>finger</em> after he <strong>slapped</strong> her half way across the room. See <a href="../v4/1785.html">row</a> (#1785 並).
