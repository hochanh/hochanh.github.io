1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 20-3-2007(58): I paint a huge <em>eye</em> on the side of my <em>pup tent</em>. Why? – It’s<strong> obvious</strong>: when I’m at the camping site it makes it<strong> obvious</strong> which tent is mine so I can quickly locate it.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NeoGlitch">NeoGlitch</a>] 18-2-2012(16): RevTKers please, open your <em>eye</em>s!! That&#039;s not a puptent you see! It&#039;s <em>kagaribi</em> (尞), fuel used for sacrifices. I know it wasn&#039;t<strong> obvious</strong> at first, but I hope it&#039;s clear to you now! :D.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 6-3-2010(10): It&#039;s<strong> obvious</strong> that the <em>pup tent</em> with a huge <em>eye</em> on the side belongs to the dark lord Sauron.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fastgolfball">fastgolfball</a>] 1-10-2010(9): It is<strong> obvious</strong> that you shouldn&#039;t be staring into <em>sacred bonfires</em> with your <em>eyes</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 21-1-2007(6): Open your <em>eyes</em>, it&#039;s<strong> obvious</strong> that not all of us can fit into that small <em>puptent</em>!
