1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 14-1-2006(418): The king&#039;s crown was blown off by the wind. &quot;Oh well,&quot; he said, &quot;it&#039;s just a<strong> superfluous</strong> symbol.&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/emanalo">emanalo</a>] 6-7-2008(51): The court jester wears a <em>crown</em> and is full of <em>wind</em> with bad jokes. He is<strong> superfluous</strong> to the King&#039;s court. This kanji is read as &quot;JOU&quot; and commonly used to create the compound for <em>jou-dan</em> 冗談 (jest or joke) hence court jester. Also <em>jou-go</em> 冗語 (redundancy) and <em>jou-in</em> 冗員 (useless workers) 員 -<a href="../v4/56.html">employee</a> (#56 員).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tanaquil">tanaquil</a>] 23-4-2007(28): Trying to put a <em>crown</em> on the <em>wind</em> is like gilding the lily: entirely<strong> superfluous</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha">Ninjasha</a>] 12-2-2008(17): The <em>wind</em> bags who wear the <em>crown</em> are almost always<strong> SUPERFLUOUS</strong> to the governance of their countries.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TadghD">TadghD</a>] 30-6-2009(10): Instead of just fluous, like the flow of the wind, I crown you<strong> superfluous</strong>.
