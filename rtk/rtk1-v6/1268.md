1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/the_marshal">the_marshal</a>] 30-4-2006(209): <strong>Once upon a time</strong>, the children were forced to eat their salad every day.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/andye">andye</a>] 11-1-2007(147): For those who don&#039;t know the expression, &quot;salad days&quot; means the time of one&#039;s youth. (originally from Shakespeare&#039;s Antony and Cleopatra - see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad_days">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad_days</a>). I suspect Heisig chose &quot;salad&quot; as the name for the radical just for this phrase...

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 20-10-2007(107): <strong>Once upon a time</strong> there was a McDonald&#039;s <em>salad</em> and it was left out in the sun for a whole <em>day</em>. But ... nothing happened because it was a McDonald&#039;s salad, chock full of preservatives and other garbage. The salad lived happily ever after (and so did the person who didn&#039;t eat it). The end. [I didn&#039;t write this... the original author deleted it... but it&#039;s my favourite story on the whole site.].

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 31-1-2010(19): This is the kanji for &quot;mukashi&quot;. Often used for &quot;once upon a time&quot; or &quot;long time ago&quot;. I will take this kanji to mean &quot;really fucking long time ago&quot;......A really fucking long time ago, I use to eat <em>salad</em> every <em>day</em> and was very slim.....those days are long gone and I&#039;m now fat as a pig...

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hujis">Hujis</a>] 2-3-2009(8): <strong>Once upon a time</strong> there was a ruler called <em>ceaser</em> (shiza sarada). He ruled everything under the <em>sun</em>, even the <em>sun</em> worshiping egyptians, until one <em>day</em> he was killed and then his <em>sun</em> Augustous took over. I think Ceaser will be an easier primitive than<strong> once upon a time</strong>. N.B. It&#039;s worked really well for me over the next couple of kanji.
