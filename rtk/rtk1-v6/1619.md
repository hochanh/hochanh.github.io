1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon">gorgon</a>] 27-2-2006(207): (I don&#039;t like the &#039;red pepper plant&#039; primative so I just go for <em>standing atop a tree</em>). Here we have the woodcutter <em>standing atop a tree</em> waving his brand<strong> new</strong> <em>axe</em>. &quot;Look what I got for christmas, yippee!&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 16-10-2005(66): Axe-man grows a patch of <em>red pepper plants</em> in his back garden. He rubs <em>red peppers</em> on the edge of his <em>axes</em>, and this seems to keep them sharp like brand<strong> new</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Angrybeez">Angrybeez</a>] 7-4-2009(43): The Red Hot <em>Chilli Peppers</em> and <em>Axe</em>l Rose form a<strong> new</strong> band.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aploosh">Aploosh</a>] 24-6-2007(24): &quot;Great. I&#039;m standing on top of a tree that&#039;s about to be cut by an axe. Well, I guess it&#039;s time for my<strong> NEW</strong> life.&quot; (Referring to reincarnation).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibilchan">chibilchan</a>] 4-10-2009(14): Don&#039;t confuse left primitive with <a href="../v4/1498.html">catalpa</a> (#1498 梓). Every time the farmer cuts down the peppers from the <em>red pepper plant</em>, he has to use a brand<strong> new</strong> axe. This is because the spicy peppers cause the metal to erode very quickly, thereby rendering the axe completely useless.
