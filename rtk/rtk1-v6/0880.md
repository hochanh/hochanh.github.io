1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SpaceCakeGirl">SpaceCakeGirl</a>] 1-1-2008(162): What a dilemna, you wore SUNGLASSES over your EYES when you went to the BIRDHOUSE so you wouldn&#039;t be recognized - but now you can&#039;t<strong> WINK</strong> at the girl you want!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 26-4-2006(158): Imagine Snoopy<strong> wink</strong>ing with his big <em>eyes</em> (and a happy smile) standing next to Woodstocks <em>Birdhouse</em>, woodstock being so cool that he wears little <em>sunglasses</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattimus">mattimus</a>] 3-2-2010(69): At the <em>whorehouse</em> a girl pulled down her <em>sunglasses</em> and<strong> wink</strong>ed at me with a <em>single massive eye</em> OMG SHE&#039;S A CYCLOPS. Didn&#039;t stop me though.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 18-1-2007(27): Out of the corner of your eye, you thought some cute girl was<strong> wink</strong>ing at you, but it turns out it was just a birdhouse with sunglasses. Isn&#039;t that always the way it turns out.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattoc_g">mattoc_g</a>] 20-4-2009(21): I prefer to use the 舛 to mean &quot;dancing legs&quot;. Makes a lot more sense to me that way. Just think of it as in the evening, you want to watch dancing legs, (you can see the two legs wrapped around a pole... right? ;) ) You go to a certain kind of &quot;BIRD&quot; HOUSE, to watch the DANCING LEGS. Your EYE is drawn to one particular set of dancing legs in the birdhouse, she has a twinkle in her eye and you blink as she<strong> WINK</strong>S at you. (This kanji also means blink and twinkle).
