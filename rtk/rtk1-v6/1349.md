1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 9-10-2007(170): Before giving your<strong> SIGNATURE</strong> to accept the LOVEDOLL, you should EYE over the LOVEDOLL for any damages, then give your<strong> SIGNATURE</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 30-6-2009(50): The <em>ninja</em>&#039;s<strong> signature</strong> move was to paralyse people just by looking in their <em>eyes</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 10-5-2007(29): Someone <em>looking askance</em> at my <em>love doll&#039;s</em><strong> signature</strong> on a waiver of liablility...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 22-9-2006(29): [signature; govt office; police station] <strong>Signature</strong>? Forget it! Retina scanners (using our <em>eyes</em> as <strong>signature</strong>) will empower governments to find <em>someone</em> in any <em>soil</em>, any <em>day</em>, rendering all of us like <em>puppets</em>!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 29-7-2006(22): The character also means &quot;public-service office or station&quot; (tax office, police station, ...). I&#039;ll use this to distinguish the kanji from other keywords like &quot;inscription&quot; that suggest a written name. Here I have a public-service station where residents can get a new<strong> signature</strong>, in calligraphy form. There are two sizes : big and small. The big one is made by the <em>cyclops</em>, and the small one by the <em>puppet</em>. So that&#039;s where you find this unlikely duo: at the<strong> signature</strong> public-service station.
