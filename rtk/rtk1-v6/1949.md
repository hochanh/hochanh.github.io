1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 26-10-2006(227): If you just grow your christmas tree in a well, there will be no need to<strong> till</strong> the soil.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stehr">stehr</a>] 17-11-2007(78): A man was<strong> till</strong>ing a new plot to plant <em>xmas trees</em> but his tractor hit an old covered-up <em>well</em> and fell halfway in, he&#039;s asking for a new tractor for xmas..

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 19-12-2007(51): Note:<strong> till</strong> in the sense of plow or cultivate, not until. (story: ergerg).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 21-12-2007(31): Plant a <em>Christmas tree</em> to mark the location of the <em>well</em>, so that those who are<strong> till</strong>ing the soil won&#039;t fall in.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax">Zarxrax</a>] 7-7-2008(15): I kept drawing a complete blank every time this Kanji would come up, so I started thinking of the phrase &quot;don&#039;t open<strong> till</strong> Xmas&quot; that you often see on Christmas presents in cartoons and things. This brought the image of the Christmas tree to my mind, and from there I could use one of the other stories.
