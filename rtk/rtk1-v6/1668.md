1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 16-8-2006(207): To ensure she remained<strong> undefiled</strong>, a young girl <em>growing up</em> in a rough area always kept a <em>dagger</em> concealed under her <em>threads</em>, even when she went into the <em>water</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tcjeff">tcjeff</a>] 17-8-2008(134): (rgravina) To ensure she remained<strong> undefiled</strong>, a young girl <em>growing up</em> in a rough area always kept a <em>dagger</em> concealed under her <em>Spiderman underwear</em> (to remember the position of <em>thread</em>), even when she went into the <em>water</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 6-2-2008(28): <em>Venom</em>&#039;s suit is self-cleaning and remains<strong> undefiled</strong>, despite its forming weapons, <em>growing up</em> into <em>daggers</em> and killing people, sending <em>drops of fluid</em> (blood) flying everywhere. No <em>water</em> necessary, and his conscience is clean too.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 26-12-2006(24): Oh no, comeback of the dirty imagery.. And I thought I got rid of that. Anyway, the &quot;grown-up dagger&quot; is a, um, phallus (are these characters like the Rorschach ink blots? Freud would be proud). Here someone ties a thread around it, so that dirty liquid won&#039;t come out of it and his surroundings remain<strong> undefiled</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 7-12-2008(17): By <em>growing up</em> with a <em>dagger</em> under his pillow, <em>Venom</em> remained<strong> undefiled</strong> until marriage. He even washed himself with holy <em>water</em> just to be sure.
