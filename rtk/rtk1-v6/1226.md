1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 28-5-2007(191): A monk won a <em>gold metal</em> for breaking the current<strong> record</strong> for most <em>swept rice</em> in one minute.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 6-8-2006(144): This character is about a <strong>record</strong>ing for a music box. The tines of the mechanism are like a <em>metal</em> <em>broom</em> and the little pins on the cylinder are like <em>metal</em> <em>grains of rice</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 4-2-2007(83): Historians have discovered an ancient<strong> record</strong> about Buddhist monastic life<strong> record</strong>ed in <em>gold</em> plates. Sadly, the only thing the monks did was use their <em>brooms</em> to sweep up <em>rice</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shakkun">shakkun</a>] 14-6-2008(38): For the combination of broom+rice I&#039;ll use Curling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling</a> where the stone has been replaced with an onigiri rice ball (thanks Katsuo). So here, the Canadian team is recieving a GOLD medal for breaking the world<strong> record</strong> for points scored in CURLING.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 16-9-2009(30): The <strong>right part</strong> should be a new <strong>primitive</strong> since it will appear several times (see <a href="../v4/1371.html">green</a> (#1371 緑), <a href="../v4/2145.html">peel off</a> (#2145 剥) and <a href="../v4/2602.html">salarium</a> (#2602 禄)) and can easily confused with similar stroke combinations. I suggest <strong>videotape</strong>, deduced from its Chinese meaning (thx shinclef).
