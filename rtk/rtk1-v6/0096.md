1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 19-11-2006(150): Actually this means <strong>town</strong>, like one that has lots of <em>streets</em> and is surrounded by all the <em>rice fields</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 20-8-2008(84): Getting this one confused with Town is easy, so remember it with this rhyme. &quot;Pillage the<strong> village</strong>, for the <em>rice</em> and and the <em>tea</em>.&quot; the street primitive on the right looks like a &#039;t&#039;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nilfisq">nilfisq</a>] 25-8-2007(63): Note: the keywords of <a href="../v4/92.html">village</a> (#92 町) and <a href="../v4/208.html">town</a> (#208 村) swap places in translated editions of RTK I. In fact, according to different dictionaries, 町 is closer to &#039;town&#039; whereas 村 is closer to &#039;village&#039;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pazustep">pazustep</a>] 1-7-2008(20): <em>Streets</em> through <em>rice fields</em> are only found in small <strong>villages</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD">PeterJD</a>] 29-3-2008(13): チョウ　まち A<strong> village</strong>/TOWN is nothing more than rice fields connected by streets.
