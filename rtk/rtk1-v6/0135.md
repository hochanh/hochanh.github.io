1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps">ceeeps</a>] 3-9-2007(202): There were 3 little islands in the <em>stream</em> who all decided to set themselves up as independent <strong>states</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD">PeterJD</a>] 29-3-2008(28): シュウ　The original meaning of this character was &quot;sandbar&quot;, and for me this conjures up images of the Mississippi River, which is very wide with many sandbars and which was used to define the borders in ten American<strong> state</strong>s. Picture Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer floating by<strong> state</strong> after<strong> state</strong> as they adventure down the mighty Mississippi, occasionally beaching their raft on sandbars.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alatown">alatown</a>] 21-2-2009(15): All powerful<strong> STATE</strong>S grew from a few small settlements along RIVER.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/panikbuton">panikbuton</a>] 20-1-2008(12): Three votes in a<strong> state</strong> election are as meaningless as as many drops in a stream.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cyberclops">cyberclops</a>] 17-1-2010(7): The<strong> state</strong> of a <em>stream</em> is not changed by adding three <em>drops</em>.
