1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wonk2001">wonk2001</a>] 5-1-2008(253): The<strong> mosquito</strong> (an <em>insect</em>) knows only one <em>sentence</em>: Bzzzzz.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Okonomiyaki">Okonomiyaki</a>] 29-6-2008(141): <strong>Mosquito</strong>es are the <em>insect</em> who love <em>Scots in plaid kilts</em> because it makes for easy access to the best parts.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 8-10-2007(24): How to tell a scottish<strong> mosquito</strong>? Easy. They are the <em>insects</em> with the <em>plaid kilts</em> on. (imagine a far side comic strip with a bunch of<strong> mosquito</strong>s at a house party).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 31-5-2007(16): Just when I thought there was no effective<strong> mosquito</strong> repellent, I found out they seem to really hate plaid sweaters!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak">wrightak</a>] 5-7-2006(11): The west coast of Scotland is one of the most beautiful places in the world. Unfortunately, there is one thing which can really &#039;bug&#039; you while you&#039;re there - midges (like a small<strong> mosquito</strong>). Imagine them getting under a Scotsman&#039;s <em>tartan</em> kilt and having a feast.
