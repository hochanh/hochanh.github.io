Your real<strong> hope</strong> is that your parents don&#039;t find out that you left the house.

Grim Reaper:&#039;Humans always have some<strong> hope</strong> to escape me...funny&#039; SCHLING... the last sound you here.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/squeaky_lill_mk">squeaky_lill_mk</a>] 15-8-2010(11): Seeing <em>Death</em> (see my stories for <a href="../v4/1488.html">reap</a> (#1488 刈), <a href="../v4/1490.html">villain</a> (#1490 凶), <a href="../v4/1493.html">kill</a> (#1493 殺), <a href="../v4/1696.html">ward</a> (#1696 区)) towering over his bed, a person hides under the <em>linen</em> <strong>hoping</strong> that <em>Death</em> would just go away. But it is<strong> hope</strong>less.
