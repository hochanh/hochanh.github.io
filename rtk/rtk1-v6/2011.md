1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 13-3-2007(158): The <em>director</em>&#039;s <em>mouth</em> dropped open as he flipped through the <em>scrapbook</em> of properties he was about to become <strong>heir</strong> to.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 27-2-2008(78): Careful with <a href="../v4/1370.html">inherit</a> (#1370 継). The egoistic <em>director</em> leaves instructions about what shall be handed down to his<strong> heir</strong> upon the director&#039;s death. First, the director&#039;s <em>mouth</em> should be surgically removed and preserved, to be handed down to his<strong> heir</strong>. Second, a scrapbook of the director&#039;s proudest scenes should also be handed down. The <em>mouth</em> reminds the<strong> heir</strong> that the <em>director</em> must be a loudmouth; the <em>scrapbook</em> reminds the<strong> heir</strong> of how to be a good director.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 15-7-2008(41): This kanji must be referring to Harry Potter. Is he the<strong> heir</strong> to Slytherin? Who knows? His <em>mouth</em> speaks parseltongue though, and Voldemort is trying to kill him from a magical <em>scrapbook</em>.. (or was that a diary? haha). Oh, and the <em>director</em> of the potions department hates him. Poor harry!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pazustep">pazustep</a>] 17-8-2008(21): The <em>director&#039;s</em> son will be<strong> heir</strong> to a big <em>mouth</em> and a <em>scrapbook</em> full of directing instructions.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hissatsu">hissatsu</a>] 21-8-2010(10): The<strong> heir</strong> opened his <em>mouth</em> in shock when the <em>director</em> of the estate told him he was only getting a <em>scrapbook</em>.
