1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 11-9-2007(189): Of course it had to be the<strong> military officer</strong>&#039;s idea to <em>glue</em> a <em>national flag</em> to the <em>altar</em> he&#039;s stationed at.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 21-2-2006(81): Perhaps you have heard about Koizumis controversial visits at the Yasukuni war memorial shrine. It is the japanese flag waving above a small stone altar. A<strong> military officer</strong> keeps watch here night and day, to honor the dead war heroes, as if he is glued to the ground.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 7-10-2007(27): Only way I remember this is think of a<strong> MILITARY OFFICER</strong> standing next to a FLAG draped ALTAR (well, the coffin is by the altar) as if GLUED to it. Might hurt if you think that GLUED primitive looks like the<strong> MILITARY OFFICER</strong> is saluting the FLAG draped ALTAR, with a slight tear coming from the eye.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 6-3-2008(22): <strong>Military officer</strong>s glue their flags to the altars of the countries they&#039;ve conquered.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KristinHolly">KristinHolly</a>] 5-9-2008(17): The<strong> military officer</strong> is even patriotic when he watches tv. Whenever there&#039;s a <em>flag</em> on the <em>show</em>, he&#039;s just <em>glue</em>d to the set.
