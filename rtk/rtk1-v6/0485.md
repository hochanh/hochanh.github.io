1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 5-7-2010(25): <strong>Print-style writing</strong> (as opposed to cursive): <em>All</em> <strong>print-style writing</strong> looks rather <em>wooden</em> to me. I prefer the fancy curves of cursive. (Note: Heisig gives this character the official keyword &quot;block letters,&quot; but based on what I&#039;ve read about the meaning of the character in the Yahoo! Japan Dictionary, I prefer &quot;print-style writing&quot;).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Magnus13">Magnus13</a>] 10-7-2011(15): <strong>Block letters</strong> (as opposed to cursive) are rigid and lifeless like <em>wood</em>; they&#039;re <em>all</em> the same size so that <em>all</em> can read them.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/enoonyllaer">enoonyllaer</a>] 21-8-2010(15): <em>all</em> the hiragana are in &quot;block letters&quot; on <em>wooden</em> blocks, like children&#039;s toys.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FoxintheStars">FoxintheStars</a>] 14-1-2011(4): Literally the <strong>block letters</strong> on children&#039;s blocks, carved into <em>wood</em> so clearly that <em>all</em> can read them.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aeryon">Aeryon</a>] 24-1-2012(3): At the base of the tree, in white<strong> block letters</strong> is written the following; &quot;In 1911, 3 men sat here and compared the whiteness of their skins. In the end it was determined that they were all white.&quot;.
