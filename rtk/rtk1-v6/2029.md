1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 22-2-2007(346): You <em>horny</em> bastard, don&#039;t<strong> come</strong>, at least <em>not yet</em>!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/volfy">volfy</a>] 12-5-2006(72): When I<strong> come</strong> home, there&#039;s nobody and no dinner waiting for me. Sigh...<em>rice</em> for <em>one</em> again.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dilandau24">dilandau24</a>] 19-4-2007(55): Here I see, of all things, Bambi. His <em>animal horns</em> have <em>not yet</em><strong> come</strong> out. (As we can see in the kanji, the <em>animal horns</em> are not at the top, not &quot;poking through&quot;. ) Remember: Bambi will soon<strong> come</strong> to have a great set of <em>animal horns</em> but they have <em>not yet</em><strong> come</strong> out.
