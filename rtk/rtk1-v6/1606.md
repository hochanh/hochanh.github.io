1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 11-7-2009(56): The <em>King</em>&#039;s<strong> crystal</strong> got <em>detached</em> from his royal throne, and is missing! Looks like the turkey got away with it. He&#039;s no where to be seen!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 16-9-2007(21): In my story for detatch <a href="../v4/1492.html">detach</a> (#1492 離), the left side primitive was <em>junkie</em>. The top-hatted villian of society with a belt around their elbow. Here, the <em>junkie</em> is getting a fix of<strong> crystal</strong> meth: the <em>jewel</em> in the crown of today&#039;s drugs.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 11-10-2008(19): <em>Michael Jackson</em> is the <em>king</em> of pop, wearing his<strong> crystal</strong> rhinestone glove (see <a href="../v4/1492.html">detach</a> (#1492 離).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 29-6-2008(14): Primitive: <em>Sheik</em> is too vague for me. How about Prince Ali, Aladdin dressed up like a sheik to impress Princess Jasmine? I&#039;ll use Aladdin or Prince Ali for this primitive, whichever works best in a story. Story: Prince Ali holds up a large<strong> crystal</strong> <em>jewel</em> to impress Princess Jasmine. She looks quite bored, but the Sultan looks thrilled!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 19-1-2009(10): When Oddjob ran out of shoes to throw he tossed a<strong> crystal</strong> ball.
