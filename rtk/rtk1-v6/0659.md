There, the three heroes asked the Wizard for three<strong> FAVOR</strong>S: the lion wanted courage of TEN men, the scarecrow wanted a BRAIN, and the tin man wanted a HEART. Ok, the lion bit is stretching but you have it memorized now, so who cares?

Or, people who do lots of<strong> favor</strong>s for others have a heart as big as 10 fields, a &quot;10-field-heart&quot;.
