1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/GhettoPenguin">GhettoPenguin</a>] 14-3-2007(498): Someone with a huge<strong> EGO</strong> is too good for any romantic partner and as such has nothing but personal &quot;<em>hand</em> <em>fiesta</em>s&quot; with himself every night.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/frozach">frozach</a>] 1-8-2007(50): Did you hear about the guy who had such a big<strong> EGO</strong> that he threw a fiesta for his left hand?

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 15-12-2007(29): At a truly excellent gay <em>fiesta</em>, <em>hands</em> are used to stroke more than just each other&#039;s <strong>egos</strong>. Graphic, perhaps ... maybe even disturbing for a few of you more prudish/phobic types ... but damned if it won&#039;t stick this way.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/haole">haole</a>] 21-1-2010(17): That guy has such a huge<strong> ego</strong>. He had to have a <em>hand</em> in everything to do with planning the <em>fiesta</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bigloui">bigloui</a>] 5-6-2006(12): The truly<strong> ego</strong>tistical prefer a <em>hand-fiesta</em> to anything anyone else can give them. Ok, its not a lovely image, but its kind of memorable. Big<strong> ego</strong>: <em>hand-fiesta</em>.
