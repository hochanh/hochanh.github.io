1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/erikkusan">erikkusan</a>] 1-4-2006(176): <strong>Bulrush</strong> was the flower that you could see near almost all bays in japan before the japanese started putting concrete everywhere. Just check how many percent of Japan&#039;s coastline that is concretised... you&#039;ll be surprised.

To her surprise, she sees a baby floating in the <strong>water</strong> on a primitive little boat made of <strong>bulrushes</strong>. After her servants swim out and retrieve the boat, they learn the baby&#039;s name by looking at his wrist bracelet <strong>dog tag</strong>. &quot;Moses,&quot; huh. Sounds Hebrew. We&#039;ll just call him<strong> Bulrush</strong> Kid for now.
