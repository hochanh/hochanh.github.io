1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne">sethimayne</a>] 22-9-2007(307): <em>Ten specialties</em> grants you the title of<strong> Dr.</strong> with a dot.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 29-7-2006(109): Watch for <a href="../v4/1694.html">doctor</a> (#1694 医), the sooner the better! In fact this kanji refers to someone well &quot;learned&quot;, with extensive knowledge. This could apply to any kind of field. The kanji 医 (&quot;doctor&quot;) is directly related to medicine. I would suggest to take away completely the idea of medicine here, and use a popular character whose name includes the keyword such as &quot;Dr. Who&quot;, &quot;Dr. Jekyll&quot;, even &quot;Dr. Dobb&#039;s&quot; if you&#039;re into programming.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DanielC">DanielC</a>] 13-7-2008(37): <em>Needles</em> are a<strong> Dr.</strong>&#039;s <em>specialty</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anthropic">anthropic</a>] 7-7-2008(31): <strong>Dr</strong>. Who weaves like a <em>needle</em> through the fabric of time, to <em>drop</em> in unexpectedly has become his <a href="../v4/46.html">specialty</a> (#46 専) .

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cangy">cangy</a>] 22-4-2010(17): Note: Use <strong>Ph.D.</strong> rather than <strong>Dr.</strong> to avoid confusion with <strong>doctor</strong> and to be more in line with common use of this kanji. <em>Ten</em> <em>specialities</em> grants you the title of <strong>Ph.D.</strong> with a <em>dot</em>.
