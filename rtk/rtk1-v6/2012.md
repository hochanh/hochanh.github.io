1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Copycatken">Copycatken</a>] 29-6-2006(188): I see this kanji as a pictograph of a two story<strong> boat</strong> seen from the front. The <em>glass canopy</em> is the body of the<strong> boat</strong>. The <em>drop</em> on top is the chimney. The horizontal line is the <em>ceiling/floor</em> between the the 1st/2nd floor. Finally, the <em>two drops</em> in the middle are the lights on the decks.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jajaaan">jajaaan</a>] 1-1-2010(54): Pictograph of a<strong> boat</strong> seen from above. The middle line is the oars. The drop on top is the rudder (at the back of the<strong> boat</strong>). The two drops inside represent the passengers: one is bent over with the effort of rowing and the other is sitting up straight, in the front of the<strong> boat</strong>, looking at the horizon for any signs of land.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 2-1-2007(29): Cinnabar ( 丹 ) colored<strong> boat</strong>, the extra drop signifying that the paint hasn&#039;t dried yet. The stick represents the oars.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 21-1-2009(26): I <em>dropped</em> a<strong> boat</strong> on your <em>mom</em>.
