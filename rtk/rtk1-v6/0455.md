Your friend decided to one-up you and stick his <em>eye</em> on the <em>tree</em>, and just then, it got super cold and a layer of<strong> frost</strong> covered the city. Your friend&#039;s <em>eye</em> got stuck on the <em>tree</em>, but he had to go home to do his homework, so he dashed off with his <em>eye</em> stuck there on the tree.
