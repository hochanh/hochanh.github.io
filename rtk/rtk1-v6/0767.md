1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 28-7-2007(190): Samurai&#039;s<strong> husk</strong>/shell/armour is superflous to missile attacks 甲殻 卵殻 貝殻 .

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nilfisq">nilfisq</a>] 30-8-2007(152): <strong>husk</strong> or <strong>shell</strong>. Japan&#039;s recent history in a nut<strong>shell</strong>: first the <em>samurai</em> became<em> superfluous </em>and then the Americans started to <em>throw missiles </em> and bombs during WWII.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 29-6-2008(124): The primitives tie so nicely into a story: upon the use of <em>missiles</em> in warfare, the traditional role of <em>samurai</em> became <em>superfluous</em> in battle. How to tie it to the keyword of &quot;husk&quot;? Easy! Afterwards, the samurai were demoted (like potato-peeling privates), and they sat around<strong> HUSK</strong>ING corn and cracking eggs and peanut shells (kanji refers to both &#039;husk&#039; and &#039;shell&#039;). A strong image to lock in the kanji: imagine samurai using their mighty swords to de-husk corn and split peanuts! Also see <a href="../v4/917.html">cereals</a> (#917 穀).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb">jameserb</a>] 12-1-2008(28): The samurai, now superfluous since the advent of the missile, was but a<strong> husk</strong> of a man. (Sumarai/Superfluous):Missile =<strong> Husk</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 3-9-2007(28): A samurai<strong> husk</strong>ing corn, which means removing the part that is superfluous, so that he can use the corn as missiles in some upcoming war.........
