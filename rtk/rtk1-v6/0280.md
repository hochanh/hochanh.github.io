1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Georgi87">Georgi87</a>] 5-9-2007(157): The mouth of the king is<strong> display</strong>ing his bling.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne">sethimayne</a>] 21-10-2007(131): What a pathetic<strong> display</strong>! The <em>king</em> is sprawled on his throne, head back and <em>mouth</em> wide open, fast asleep. We should never have let him drink so much at that banquet last night.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jezerey">jezerey</a>] 11-2-2008(57): The mouth of the king<strong> display</strong>ed what a fool he was.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Twentytw0">Twentytw0</a>] 9-7-2008(30): Think of an evil museum that<strong> display</strong>s the <em>mouths</em> of the previous dead <em>kings</em>. Imagine the tour guide dressed up in sinister clothing saying, &quot;And on<strong> display</strong> here, we have the <em>mouth</em> of <em>King</em> Henry VIII&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thatkidpercy">thatkidpercy</a>] 29-11-2007(23): The original court jesters had a terrible job, if the <em>king</em>&#039;s <em>mouth</em> yawned during your<strong> DISPLAY</strong>, it was the end of you.
