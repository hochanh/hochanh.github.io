1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 15-1-2008(246): To live a<strong> comfortable</strong> life, single men need only a cave for living, a rake for cleaning and a screwdriver for fixing.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 3-8-2006(68): When I first moved in to my new <em>cave</em>, all I had was a bed (see <a href="../v4/592.html">bed</a> (#592 床)). But now I&#039;ve settled in, got myself a few handy things like a <em>rake</em> and a <em>screwdriver</em>, and made myself more<strong> comfortable</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb">jameserb</a>] 27-4-2008(49): To make your cave more<strong> comfortable</strong>, you&#039;ll need to do some work with a rake and screwdriver. Clean it up. Fix a few things.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 24-11-2008(21): Commonplace seems like a better keyword for this, though it&#039;s easier to confuse with others like &quot;usual&quot; and &quot;mediocre&quot;. In this case, commonplace refers to something ordinary and non-exceptional. I picture a commonplace caveman&#039;s cave, with very ordinary, non-fancy, cave drawings he did with a screwdriver because he couldn&#039;t afford a writing brush. You have to visualize him etching the drawings with the screwdriver.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 8-2-2008(18): (Thanks rtkrtk) To live a<strong> comfortable</strong> life, the Flintstones need only a cave for living, a rake for cleaning and a screwdriver for fixing.
