1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 21-1-2008(149): If I find out this furniture you&#039;re selling me is made of<strong> imitation</strong> <em>wood</em>, I&#039;ll put you in the <em>graveyard</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha">Ninjasha</a>] 15-1-2008(67): The Japanese are so enamored of everything plastic, they even put<strong> IMITATION</strong> plastic <em>trees</em> in their <em>graveyards</em>! (No, not really, but I wouldn&#039;t be surprised).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elanlan">elanlan</a>] 29-12-2009(40): This kanji was a real asshole. No one liked this kanji. That is why that when this kanji died, no one cared, and it received a <em>wooden</em>,<strong> imitation</strong> tombstone; not a fancy marble one, at its resting place in the <em>graveyard</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/peepiceek">peepiceek</a>] 14-5-2008(22): The<strong> imitation</strong> <em>tree</em> looked like a <em>big sun flower</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 8-5-2006(21): <strong>imitation</strong>: we left a wodden sculpture (an <strong>imitation</strong>) at the <em>graveyard</em> of our old dog. (<strong>graveyard</strong>: were we put <em>flowers</em> for our deceased <em>big St. Bernard</em>, good ol&#039; <em>Sunny</em>).
