1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 11-1-2009(68): They won&#039;t let me in <em>The Pinnacle</em>, but I can see a <em>little</em> bit of <em>sun</em> through this <em>little</em> <strong>chink</strong> in the wall. Hmm, maybe I could make this <strong>chink</strong> bigger...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/steves">steves</a>] 3-10-2007(46): There was only one<strong> chink</strong> in his plan. Even standing atop the highest <em>pinnacle</em>, standing above even the <em>sun</em>, the <em>little</em> man was still just as <em>little</em> as when he was under the sun.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 5-6-2007(18): Man those <em>little</em> <strong>chinks</strong> can do anything! They were the first to build rockets, and by launching one off the top of the highest <em>pinnacle</em> in China, one <em>little</em><strong> chink</strong> was the first to ride <em>above the sun</em>, and see all the <em>little</em><strong> chink</strong>s below!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 19-6-2007(4): In a wall at <em>The Pinnacle</em>, there must be a<strong> chink</strong> in the wall because I see some <em>small</em> rays of <em>sun</em>light peepin&#039; through, up there and down there.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 16-9-2009(3): Daedalus, a talented craftsman, attempted to escape from his exile, where he and his son Icarus were imprisoned. Daedalus fashioned two pairs of wings out of wax and feathers for himself and his son (you can see them flying in the sky, they are very <em>small</em>) However, Icarus did not listen to his father warning and flew too high - even above the <em>sun</em>! The wax melted and the wings got<strong> chink</strong>s. The end of this old story? Icarus crashed onto the <em>pinnacles</em> (small variation of the original story)...
