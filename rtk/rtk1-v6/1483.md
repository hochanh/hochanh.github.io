1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 31-7-2009(78): People aside, I wonder <em>how many rice fields</em> there are in the<strong> capital suburbs</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 22-1-2009(14): <em>How many brains</em> does it take to run the<strong> capital suburbs</strong>?

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/einahpets">einahpets</a>] 28-2-2012(8): This keyword refers to Japan&#039;s Kinki Region, a historic name for present-day Kansai. 近畿 きんき Just <em>how many rice fields</em> are in the<strong> capital suburbs</strong>? (The kinky (Kinki) <em>people</em> are hidden in the fields so you can&#039;t see them).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sulris">sulris</a>] 18-4-2011(8): The<strong> capital suburbs</strong> were the five areas that around the kyoto nara osaka area that were under direct imperial rule (not ruled by the feudal lords) (the capital being first nara then kyoto) in this time the most important thing was how many rice fields you had. and as the area grew in the large cities that emporer had less and less rice fields (the latter half is not true).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 14-10-2007(5): While exploring the capital you come across a <em>cocoon fiesta</em> being held in a <em>paddyfield</em>. &quot;There&#039;s no space for this kind of thing in the city centre, we must be in the<strong> capital suburbs</strong>,&quot; you think.
