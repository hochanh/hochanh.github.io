4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scotty28">scotty28</a>] 14-7-2009(6): Imagine a beat up<strong> liver</strong>(too much alcohol). The doctor takes your<strong> liver</strong> out of your body, and puts it on a clothes line to dry off. Then puts it back in your body, sealing up the flesh. A dry<strong> liver</strong> is a healthy<strong> liver</strong> he chuckles as he puts it back.
