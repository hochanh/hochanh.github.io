1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Reikon">Reikon</a>] 4-8-2007(223): People at<strong> Universal</strong> Studios wait in rows so long that the sun goes down.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 9-12-2006(57): To me, <em>row</em> is way too close to <a href="../v4/812.html">file</a> (#812 列), so I&#039;m adopting Fab&#039;s meaning of <em>rowboat</em> from the previous frame.<strong> Universal</strong> Studios went through a number of logo animations before settling on the one they are most famous for: the letters<strong> UNIVERSAL</strong> orbiting the Earth. One of the most ridiculous of these involved a man <em>rowing</em> himself in a boat around the <em>sun</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/redskatz">redskatz</a>] 6-4-2009(35): It is a <strong>universal</strong> human desire to sit in <em>rows</em> to watch the <em>sun</em> go down.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup">mezbup</a>] 1-7-2009(22): If every planet lined up in a row with the sun there would be a<strong> universal</strong> solar eclipse.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ivantolearnkanji">ivantolearnkanji</a>] 19-4-2008(14): A song<strong> universal</strong>ly known among the kinder, at least in the English-speaking world, is &quot;<em>Row, Row, Row</em> Your Boat&quot; - sung by a row of schoolchildren, <em>tongues wagging in the mouth</em> as in <a href="../v4/21.html">chant</a> (#21 唱).
