1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 28-10-2005(315): A <em>fledgling</em> is being nursed at a zoo, it is fed<strong> milk</strong> through a small tube that is bent in the shape of a <em>hook</em> (so that it fits inside its beak). The <em>fledgling</em> soon becomes addicted to<strong> milk</strong>, giving us this very catchy mnemonic: “<em>fledgling hooked</em> on<strong> milk</strong>”.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stehr">stehr</a>] 1-10-2007(67): Drinking<strong> milk</strong> not only reduces <a href="../v4/96.html">cavity</a> (#96 孔)&#039;s but also strengthens <em>nails</em> (claws) thanks astgtciv.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TunS77">TunS77</a>] 27-9-2008(50): This <em>fledgling</em> is <em>hooked</em> on<strong> MILK</strong>.. better than booze I suppose...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astgtciv">astgtciv</a>] 11-1-2007(22): This is very similar to <a href="../v4/96.html">cavity</a> (#96 孔) (&quot;Drink<strong> milk</strong>, it reduces cavities!&quot;, says the dentist). The only difference is that the child here is a <em>baby eagle</em>, a fledgling.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 1-3-2011(19): As a <em>child</em>, <em>Wolverine</em> became <em>hook</em>ed on<strong> milk</strong>...and that&#039;s how he grew those claws (excess calcium). 牛乳 (ぎゅうにゅう) : cow&#039;s<strong> milk</strong>.
