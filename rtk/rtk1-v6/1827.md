1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 8-3-2007(280): <em>Young</em> kids likes to <strong>hide</strong> in <em>cardboard boxes</em>. (Primitive: <em>CARDBOARD BOX</em>, especially kids playing with them.).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 28-7-2007(61): Note that stroke order with <em>box</em> primitive is as follows: first horizontal line, then enclosed element, and then a hook (it&#039;s incorrect in 4th edition).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cheesemaster64">Cheesemaster64</a>] 10-6-2009(35): This kanji doesn&#039;t really mean <strong>hide</strong> in the sense of<strong> hide</strong> and seek. It is more towards the meaning of hiding one&#039;s identity. --------------------------AKA <strong>anonymity</strong>----------- Schools are getting so strict now about personal identity, that they make <em>young</em> children keep <strong>anonymity</strong> by making them wear <em>cardboard</em> boxes over there heads.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax">Zarxrax</a>] 12-6-2008(16): Primitive = Solid Snake. <em>Solid Snake</em><strong> hide</strong>s in a <em>cardboard box</em> so he wont be detected. He&#039;s loved hiding in boxes ever since he was <em>young</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ghinzdra">ghinzdra</a>] 3-5-2008(5): When I was YOUNG I used to play to<strong> hide</strong> and seek ....Everything was good for that : even and old BOX . I was quite innocent at that time .... Later I learned games of adult : especially lies and conceal one&#039;s feelings.... NB : In order to avoid confusion with <a href="../v4/1313.html">conceal</a> (#1313 隠)<strong> hide</strong> is given a material meaning while conceal will be more intellectual .... The background of youth strenghten this conception.
