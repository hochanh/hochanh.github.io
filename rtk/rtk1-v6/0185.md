1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 30-7-2007(141): The<strong> ri</strong> is a Japanese way of measuring the area of the GROUND underneath a<strong> RI</strong>CE FIELD.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 18-12-2007(86): Hint: Heisig makes here a severe disservice to everyone by using a weird keyword for this character. You&#039;ll save a lot (and I mean, a whole lot) of trouble later by giving it instead its intended meaning: <strong>House of the Parents</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Bullfrog">Bullfrog</a>] 15-4-2008(49): It&#039;s not just any computer. It&#039;s an old Ata<strong>ri</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 27-2-2011(35): My <strong>parents&#039; house</strong> is on a <em>rice field</em>; I <em>compute</em> the <em>ground</em> area being one <strong>ri</strong> by one <strong>ri</strong>. 古里 (ふるさと) : home town, birthplace, old village, historic village, native place, one&#039;s old home; 郷里 (きょうり) : birth-place, home town.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry">elktapestry</a>] 1-2-2009(33): It frustrates me that Hesig doesn&#039;t give any mention to another prominent meaning of the 里 /<strong> Ri</strong> Kanji being used for さと meaning a country village or home. perhaps he thought it would be too confusing for one to remember two different types of villages and distinguish this from 町 ... however... If I think of that one as まち and this one as さと it keeps things straight in my head and allows me to skip the whole confusing path of thinking of this as a &quot;computer&quot; which just seems somewhat wrong.
