1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 1-5-2008(244): What <em>part of the body</em> has a <em>very, very, very powerful</em> smell? The<strong> armpit</strong>, of course!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dshill99">dshill99</a>] 1-7-2008(71): <strong>Armpit</strong> is the <em>flesh</em> near your <em>tri</em>ceps.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/takoman">takoman</a>] 11-3-2008(51): (no important on yomi) The part of Conan&#039;s body that is three times more effective at defeating foes than his muscles are his stinky<strong> ARMPIT</strong>s. [Note: Typically, when the flesh primitive is on the left side it refers to a body part - this helps distinguish in from <a href="../v4/871.html">threaten</a> (#871 脅)].

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/manos">manos</a>] 14-9-2007(33): The piece of flesh between the triceps and the deltoid muscle (note how the 3 strengths form a neat delta) is the<strong> armpit</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 9-2-2006(19): The part of the body on your flank, where the triceps is attached, is the<strong> armpit</strong>. Note: the kanji is often used in the sense of “flank” or “side”. The<strong> armpit</strong> is a part of the body on your sides/flanks.
