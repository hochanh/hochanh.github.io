1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew">Matthew</a>] 11-7-2006(222): The <em>St. Bernard dog</em> whining at the <em>door</em> of his master’s house in order to<strong> re-</strong>enter /<strong> re-</strong>turn inside.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thermal">thermal</a>] 16-6-2008(140): This is common with cats, but also happens with dogs. They go out the door. 5 minutes later they change their minds and come back in. They<strong> re-</strong>go out the door. They<strong> re-</strong>come back in. They<strong> re-</strong>go out the door. They<strong> re-</strong>come back in. They<strong> re-</strong>go out the door. They<strong> re-</strong>come back in. They<strong> re-</strong>go out the door. They<strong> re-</strong>come back in. They<strong> re-</strong>go out the door. They<strong> re-</strong>come back in. They<strong> re-</strong>go out the door. They<strong> re-</strong>come back in. They<strong> re-</strong>go out the door. AAAAAARRRRRGGGHHHH!!!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wasurenaide">wasurenaide</a>] 16-11-2007(78): Think about hachiko, the <em>dog</em> waiting at the <em>door</em> of the station, waiting for his master to <em>re-</em>turn.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RobMow">RobMow</a>] 16-9-2008(25): This story can help you remember this Kanji as well as the next frame <a href="../v4/1082.html">tears</a> (#1082 涙). When the <em>lost dog</em><strong> re-</strong>turned to his master&#039;s <em>doorstep</em>, the two<strong> re-</strong>joiced at their happy<strong> re-</strong>union.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/unauthorized">unauthorized</a>] 12-11-2009(17): Hint: This is the kanji used in the verb 戻る [もどる] which means &quot;to return, to turn back&quot;. I suggest using &quot;turn back&quot; as keyword, which is far easier to remember compared to the abstract &quot;re-&quot;. Do not confuse with <a href="../v4/725.html">return</a> (#725 返) which has the meaning of the verb かえる - to return, to come back.
