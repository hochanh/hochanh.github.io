1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 12-6-2008(267): This character is used in two very high-frequency words: &quot;you are welcome&quot; ( どう致しまして ) and the honorific form of onegaishimasu ( お願い致します ; おねがいいたします). Can&#039;t you just picture this ridiculously polite S&amp;M picture? A businessman, who<strong> DOTH</strong> the bidding of his <em>taskmistress</em>, is <em>climaxing</em> and yelling out &quot; お願い致します &quot; while she whips and says &quot; どう致しまして &quot;. (This kanji also means &quot;to bring about&quot; and &quot;do humbly&quot;, which is perfect for this image).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 23-4-2007(208): To reach <em>climax</em> I<strong> doth</strong> the bidding of my dominatrix <em>taskmaster</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall">pmbeddall</a>] 7-11-2007(35): After he had climaxed Shakespeare is reported to have said to his <em>taskmistress</em>, &quot;The lady<strong> doth</strong> charge too much.&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 27-11-2008(24): Let&#039;s have an irreverent take on a line from the play “Hamlet”, by William Shakespeare : “The lady<strong> doth</strong> protest too much.” : “The climaxing taskmistress<strong> doth</strong> whippeth too much”. Our taskmistress is enjoying the whipping so much, she climaxes. My taskmistress image comes from the classic game “Dungeon Keeper”. In this game, the “mistress” character is dressed in a &#039;domination&#039; outfit, and whips your servants (goblins etc.) to make them work faster.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eltjopoort">eltjopoort</a>] 31-5-2008(22): The <em>taskmaster</em> is my old English teacher. He loved Shakespeare, and the <em>climax</em> if his day was to hear his pupils say<strong> doth</strong>.
