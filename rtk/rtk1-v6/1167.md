1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 26-5-2007(203): A boy made an <em>altar</em>, but he&#039;s afraid to<strong> show</strong> it to God because he thinks it&#039;s <em>two little</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BigAmish">BigAmish</a>] 15-8-2008(86): &quot;I&#039;ll<strong> SHOW</strong> you mine if you<strong> show</strong> me yours!&quot;, she said. I did &amp; she scoffed because it was <em>TWO LITTLE</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 8-3-2007(44): I give this form a primitive of <em>EVIL ALTAR</em>. Imagine a black stone altar used for satanic rituals. I give the left radical form a primitive of <em>CHURCH ALTAR</em>. Imagine a beautiful cathedral altar.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hyreia">Hyreia</a>] 23-3-2009(35): Unrelated: Frankly, I found Chapter 30 BORING. (I guess I was spoiled with Mr. T.) To jazz up the excitement, this ENTIRE chapter is all about one very crazy religion that exists today (in your imagination). What are the specifics? That&#039;s for you to find out. The clues? The next 39 kanji. Just look at some of the keywords: Altar, oil, sleeve, collar, speakth, naked!!! Be sure to give altar it&#039;s own meaning inside the cult you&#039;re creating.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 20-5-2009(7): A picture of an altar. <em>Two small things</em> are placed on it to<strong> show</strong> them off (I imagine two watches covered in diamonds).
