1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 31-10-2007(236): A pretty tough kanji. Think of elegant old housewives with English accents dining together at a HOUSE party. The hostess brings out a dish of hors d&#039;oeuvres: a SPIKE of metal with an EYEBALL and a HEART skewered on it. Upon being offered this treat, one of the housewives says in her English accent, &quot;I&#039;d<strong> RATHER</strong> not.&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saranich">saranich</a>] 25-3-2006(235): <strong>Rather</strong> a house with a heart than an eye with a spike.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 8-11-2008(63): Did your parents ever tell you that <em>home</em> is where the <em>heart</em> is? Maybe that&#039;s because they want to keep an <em>eye</em> on you. They&#039;d<strong> rather</strong> you were inside, than on the <em>streets</em>. Sadly, crack doesn&#039;t sell itself.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Samsara">Samsara</a>] 3-9-2008(43): I&#039;d<strong> rather</strong> die peacefully in my <em>house</em> from a <em>heart</em> attack than from a <em>spike</em> in my <em>eye</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus">scottamus</a>] 9-3-2006(42): Picture a racist railroad foreman from the days when the wild west was being tamed. &quot;I&#039;d<strong> rather</strong> be at my house eatin&#039; and drinkin&#039; my way to a heart attack than watching these slanty eyed Chinese immigrants hammering railroad spikes&quot;.
