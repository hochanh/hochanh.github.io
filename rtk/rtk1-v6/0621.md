2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pazustep">pazustep</a>] 22-7-2008(64): Trees need space to grow. If you <em>pent in</em> a <em>tree</em>, it will be in quite a<strong> quandary</strong>!

What a<strong> quandary</strong> -- should you stay in paradise with the tree of knowledge or should you go out into the world?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tuuli">tuuli</a>] 12-12-2007(20): To solve a<strong> quandary</strong>, you have to think outside the <em>box.</em> For example, how do I get this huge Christmas <em>tree</em> into through the door?
