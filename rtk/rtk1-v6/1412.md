1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 19-9-2007(223): <em>The Pinnacle</em> is actually <em>bound up</em> by supports from <em>olden times</em>. Eventually, they give out, and the whole thing starts to<strong> collapse</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 19-12-2007(91): <em>The Pinnacle</em> is supported by pilings which were <em>bound up</em> in <em>olden times</em>. One day when the bindings rot away, the whole thing will<strong> collapse</strong>. (tweaking dihutensoa&#039;s story to work a little better for me).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb">jameserb</a>] 6-8-2008(40): At the pinnacle of any society&#039;s development, being overly bound to rules from olden times leads to<strong> collapse</strong> (see Jared Diamond&#039;s<strong> Collapse</strong>).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 24-1-2008(24): The adventurers reached the <em>pinnacle</em>, and claimed the artefact which had been <em>bound up</em> since <em>olden times</em>: the <em>staff</em> of the <em>Sun</em> God. But as soon as they removed it, the place began to<strong> collapse</strong>! Will they make it out in time??

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/genevere">genevere</a>] 25-4-2009(11): The<strong> collapse</strong> of the pinnacle society occurred after they were <em>bound up</em> in <em>olden times</em> beliefs and practices and thereby failed to progress.
