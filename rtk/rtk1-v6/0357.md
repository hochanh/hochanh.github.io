Just make Socrates the subject of your stories and whenever Socrates shows up you&#039;ll know this character should be written. Just picture him in his toga with a hand up in the air looking philisophical. You can try some other well spoken individual as long as they bring to mind speech, words, or<strong> say</strong>.
