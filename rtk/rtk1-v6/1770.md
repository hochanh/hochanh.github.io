1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 28-4-2007(261): &quot;<strong>Decide</strong>!&quot; &quot;<strong>Decide</strong>?! Death by drowning in polluted <em>water</em> or death by <em>guillotine</em>. How can I <strong>decide</strong>?&quot; I asked.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cangy">cangy</a>] 2-4-2008(108): To<strong> decide</strong> if someone is a witch or not first dunk them in <em>water</em>. If they don&#039;t drown they are a witch and can be sent to the <em>guillotine</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 17-2-2011(31): (Seriously, do we really need the guillotine primitive? Surely <em>key</em> and <em>person</em> are adequate...) I have<strong> decide</strong>d that drinking more water is the <em>key</em> to becoming a more healthy <em>person</em>. 決まる きまる be<strong> decide</strong>d, fixed, certain; 決める きめる<strong> decide</strong>, fix, choose; 決心 けっしん determination, resolution; 決定 けってい decision, determination; 解決 かいけつ settlement, solution, resolution.

The <strong>Decide</strong>r has<strong> decide</strong>d both these are legal and moral. I keep mixing this up with <a href="../v4/1074.html">choose</a> (#1074 択). Try associating these negative options with our half-wit &quot;decider&quot; to build a distinction.
