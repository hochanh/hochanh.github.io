1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nac_est">nac_est</a>] 21-7-2007(324): After months of practice, you finally managed to teach a nice trick to your sled-pulling <em>four bound up St. Bernard dogs</em>: one snap of your <em>fingers</em> and they<strong> interchange</strong> their positions.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 18-6-2007(62): On the snap of your <em>fingers</em>, the <em>four St. Bernard dogs bound up</em><strong> interchange</strong> places.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 2-3-2009(40): <strong>Note:</strong> 奐 means &quot;clear; bright.&quot; The keyword <a href="../v4/20.html">bright</a> (#20 明) is already used. However, among all the 3000 Kanjis presented by Heisig, the keyword <em>clear</em> alone is not used, so you might want to use it to refer to this radical. <strong>Story:</strong> With their fast <em>finger</em> movement, it was not <em>clear</em> that any<strong> interchange</strong> was taking place.

Truth is, they&#039;re pretty much<strong> interchange</strong>able...just pick one out with your <em>finger</em>...eeeny meeny miney moe...
