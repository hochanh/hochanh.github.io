1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 26-8-2006(276): Primatives <em>celing; belt; mountain</em> as per Cumulative Errata. See volfy post for link.<strong> Both</strong> effective ways to commit suicide, hang your self from the <em>celing</em> with your <em>belt</em> or jump off a <em>mountain</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 19-2-2008(37): Under one <em>ceiling</em><strong> both</strong> took off their <em>belts</em> in Brokeback <em>Mountain</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 14-5-2007(36): Be careful with this one. The correct primitive order is <em>ceiling</em> . . . <em>belt</em> . . . <em>mountain</em>. That said, in the Mario video games, there are some levels where spikes hang from the <em>ceiling</em> and there are large conveyor <em>belts</em>. One example is Koopa <em>Mountain</em>. Imagine<strong> both</strong> Mario and Luigi trying to get through the level unscathed.

Everyone should take a look and correct all the listed errors in the book.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 12-3-2008(16): <strong>Both</strong> the ceiling of heaven and the mountains are belted to the Earth.
