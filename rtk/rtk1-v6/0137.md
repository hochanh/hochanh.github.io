1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 8-11-2007(67): The kanji for<strong> water</strong> is an abstract primitive itself, so unless one is willing to break down its etymological development, it should just simply be memorized by strokes; constructing a story is not necessarily useful unless it strongly denotes its shape (I find that Heisig&#039;s story doesn&#039;t do this).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CandyCane">CandyCane</a>] 5-10-2008(54): For those having issues with this* &quot;A 7K foot pool of<strong> water</strong>&quot; Notice it looks like a 7, and a K. Might have to practice writing it a few times.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ozmos">Ozmos</a>] 10-9-2009(34): When you squeeze a stream you get<strong> water</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 24-7-2007(6): Dropping a hooked walking stick into the<strong> water</strong> causes a splash. (The primitive is often contracted to just two drops and a walking stick).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/foros">foros</a>] 7-3-2010(4): Dropping the <em>walking stick</em> into the<strong> water</strong> sent out <em>droplets</em> in 4 directions.
