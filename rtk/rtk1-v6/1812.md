1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 19-12-2006(230): Do you know how they make those<strong> FRAGRANT</strong> air fresheners? Well you take some FLOWERS, compress them with a HEAVY weight, and put them on an OVEN FIRE for a while... (cmp <a href="../v4/493.html">perfume</a> (#493 芳)).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blackstockc">blackstockc</a>] 16-3-2008(46): The heavier the flowers the stronger their fragrance when you burn them.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/squeaky_lill_mk">squeaky_lill_mk</a>] 15-8-2010(30): These <em>flowers</em> emit very <em>heavy</em> <strong>fragrance</strong> when burned <em>over the fire</em> (e.g. the <strong>fragrant</strong> jasmine flowers).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/takoman">takoman</a>] 10-6-2008(24): (クン) Steve Jobs does it again. This heavy duty mac computer has a place for flowers on top. When the computer heats up (the fire on the bottom), the flowers release a beautiful<strong> fragrant</strong> smell.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 27-9-2008(13): As the <em>heavy duty truck</em> smolders in <em>flames</em>, the<strong> fragrant</strong> smell of <em>flowers</em> is emitted from the pine tree air freshener still hanging from the rear-view mirror.
