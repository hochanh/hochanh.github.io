1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 14-12-2007(221): <strong>Grace</strong> here is a favor freely bestowed, like a good deed. So to remember this kanji, go to the local shelter, find a <em>big dog pent up in a small cage</em> and adopt him. That will <em>cause</em> a warm feeling in your <em>heart</em>!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(111): This kanji tells us that wherever heart is the cause,<strong> grace</strong> is the consequence. Think of “grace” as a<strong> grace</strong>ful act: something benevolent that comes from the heart.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 10-12-2008(74): <strong>Grace</strong> is when you give from your <em>heart</em> to serve a higher <em>cause</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 27-5-2008(38): A<strong> grace</strong> is a gift whose only <em>cause</em> for being given comes from the <em>heart</em>. WARNING: Do not confuse with <a href="../v4/721.html">graceful</a> (#721 淑) - this kanji and it&#039;s meaning have nothing to do with being<strong> grace</strong>ful.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astgtciv">astgtciv</a>] 5-1-2007(30): <strong>Grace</strong> Kelly died be<em>cause</em> of her <em>heart</em> condition. I.e., her <em>heart</em> was the <em>cause</em>. It was because of all that dancing... that&#039;s how the story goes. But really, what happened is that she accidentally locked in her St. Bernard for 5 days without food, and when she came back home he ripped out and swallowed her heart.
