1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lbphenom">lbphenom</a>] 12-1-2008(43): A<strong> child</strong> who is <em>ten</em> will still ask for his <em>ma</em> (top looks a bit like katakana ma).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 28-1-2008(30): A pictograph of a<strong> child</strong>, with arms outstretched for mother (or perhaps because she is chasing a rat?). Note that this kanji occupies the first space on the Zodiac circle, and is the sign for the rat (such as 2008!).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Po0py">Po0py</a>] 15-12-2008(21): A ten year old<strong> child</strong> with a baseball cap.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jeromin">Jeromin</a>] 21-12-2008(9): A<strong> child</strong>, from one to ten, before becoming a teen.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NyahK">NyahK</a>] 6-6-2010(6): I&#039;d imagine most people knew this long before starting RTK. When they were still a <strong>child</strong> of kanji, perhaps?
