1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 20-1-2006(200): Funny.. this appeared to me as a pictograph of a samurai&#039;s<strong> armor</strong>. Then I looked up images of the samurai<strong> armor</strong> and it is not even remotely similar. Then I realised it looks in fact like the belly of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which I somehow associated with the samurai<strong> armor</strong> because of the &quot;turtle samurai&quot; that appeared earlier. Fits me. The bit that pokes down is to protect the genitals, I guess.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu">ruisu</a>] 21-11-2007(156): It looks like a bird&#039;s eye view of a tank (modern<strong> armor</strong>).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 22-8-2006(60): Pictograph. Kendo visor with chin guard.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wile_e42">Wile_e42</a>] 17-4-2008(36): Armour weighs you down like you’re rooted to the ground.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 4-1-2010(14): Looks like an<strong> armor</strong>ed helmet. You have the part that protects the <em>brain</em> and a little line beneath that acts as a nose guard.
