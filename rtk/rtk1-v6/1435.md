1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 8-1-2010(215): Important:<strong> Luxuriant</strong> does NOT mean luxurious, as the other stories indicate. Definition: abundant or lush in growth, as vegetation. When <em>Venom</em> realized he couldn&#039;t beat <em>Spider-Man</em> in a fair fight, he showed his <em>cleverness</em> by spraying venom all over Spider-Man&#039;s<strong> luxuriant</strong> garden.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 26-1-2008(52): <em>Venom</em> is covered in a<strong> luxuriant</strong> and surprisingly <em>clever</em> symbiotic suit, but it&#039;s also the <em>taskmaster</em> for his <em>every</em> evil act.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 31-12-2006(43): <em>Every taskmaster&#039;s threads</em> are<strong> luxuriant</strong>, made with only the best fabrics in all the brightest colours.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurenai_no_Buta">Kurenai_no_Buta</a>] 3-6-2008(29): Key word is <em>luxuriant</em> (abundant or lush in growth, as vegetation; teeming). <em>Venom</em> uses his <em>cleverness</em> to create a<strong> luxuriant</strong> garden, teeming with<strong> luxuriant</strong> vegetation, in a bid to lure Mary Jane into his clutches.
