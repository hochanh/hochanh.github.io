1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 19-11-2007(126): This guy would rather use his <em>pup-tent</em> as a <em>house</em>, than sleep in the<strong> dormitory</strong>. So he effectively turned that <em>pup-tent</em> into a <em>house</em> by getting a postal address for it etc. (just to emphasize house).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 23-11-2006(62): All-male <strong>dormitories</strong> in Japan are really weird, and tend to have a little too much 男気 . Here is a trick they play where if they find that one dorm member has pitched a &quot;<em>pup tent</em>&quot; while sleeping, they make it into a <em>house</em> by putting a little roof on top of it -- complete with a lit cigarette for a chimney -- and wait for the &quot;fun&quot; to start (fun meaning...lighting their friend&#039;s genitals on fire).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mfistik">mfistik</a>] 18-9-2007(48): A<strong> dormitory</strong> room has the same characteristics of a pup tent, meaning that it&#039;s small and usually sleeps two people (you and your room mate), however you have an actual roof over your head.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 18-6-2009(37): To please gods and pass next exams you set a whole<strong> dormitory</strong> (<em>house</em>) afire. Wow! What a <em>sacred bonfire</em>!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/noname">noname</a>] 22-2-2008(14): A<strong> DORMITORY</strong> HOUSE has all the same characteristics as a PUP TENT; smelly, old, cramped, etc.
