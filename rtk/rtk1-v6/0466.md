1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 6-7-2006(254): The crazy<strong> sovereign</strong> stands up from his throne, wearing nothing but a crown and a towel. That&#039;s why they try to keep him locked up in the castle away from the public.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 16-2-2008(51): This one is so tricky for me. The key is to remember that the bottom stroke on the <em>standing</em> element takes those little crown &quot;winglets&quot; on the right and left. The most effective image might be of QEII (who is quite short) using her crown as a kind of stool. She&#039;s <em>standing</em> on her <em>crown</em> rummaging through a high cupboard looking for her <em>apron.</em> I guess the<strong> sovereign</strong>&#039;s servants have the day off.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep">johnzep</a>] 31-3-2007(34): Imaging queen Elizabeth...england&#039;s<strong> SOVEREIGN</strong> as she STANDS at the sink doing dishes wearing nothing but an APRON.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 21-7-2009(15): The<strong> sovereign</strong> likes to make his female servants <em>stand</em> around in nothing but <em>aprons</em>. Can&#039;t say I blame him.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wisher">Wisher</a>] 31-8-2008(12): The first thing you need to be a<strong> SOVEREIGN</strong>, is to STAND TALL above your people and inspire them with confidence. The second would be to wear a cool CROWN. Third and most important, please wear underwear or at least a TOWEL to cover up you privates. People are going to be &quot;looking up to you.&quot; (Inspired by WithLoveFromExIA&#039;s post).
