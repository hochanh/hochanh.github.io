1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 14-2-2007(222): <em>Maestro</em>, coattails flapping wildly, is being <strong>chase</strong>d down the <em>road</em> by his fans.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sleepyday">sleepyday</a>] 26-10-2008(51): This Kanji reminds me of Nodame Cantabile. I just have to imagine Chiaki, our <em>maestro</em> in training, getting<strong> chase</strong>d by Nodame down the <em>road</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 8-4-2007(50): <em>Maestro</em> primative = <em>James Bond</em>. Here he gives<strong> chase</strong> down the <em>road</em> to the bad guys. I&#039;m thinking of the car<strong> chase</strong> in &#039;The Man with the Golden Gun&#039; - NOT <a href="../v4/539.html">pursue</a> (#539 逐). I think about &#039;Race N<strong> Chase</strong>&#039; (a scalextric type toy)...there were no pigs in &#039;Race N<strong> Chase</strong>&#039;, only cars.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 2-3-2011(33): I&#039;m going to use Beyonce as the primitive meaning. She&#039;s a bit of a musical maestro herself AND she has an amazing butt, so all the bases are covered. Plus the radical looks like a &#039;B&#039;! So this kanji is a pictograph of me <strong>chasing</strong> gorgeous <em>Beyonce</em> down the <em>road</em>. Mmm, Beyonce! (drool). 追う おう run after, drive out; 追い付く おいつく overtake, catch up (with); 追放 ついほう banishment, exile; 追加 ついか supplement, addition.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jslindst">jslindst</a>] 6-3-2009(9): I use Bond for the Maestro (the primitive also resembles B). Here you see James <em>Bond</em> being<strong> chase</strong>d on a road.
