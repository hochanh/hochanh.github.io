So 左 is written horizontal, vertical, horizontal... 右 is written vertical, horizontal, vertical... 有 is vertical, horizontal, vertical... etc. (The ONLY exception to this rule comes with elbow [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/743">masculine/male</a> (#743 雄) 雄 ], which is written horizontal, vertical, vertical(ish)...).
