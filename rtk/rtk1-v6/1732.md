1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rptb1">rptb1</a>] 12-11-2005(270): In the Old West there were no<strong> ballot</strong> boxes. Afraid of fraud and fighting among the gunslingers, the<strong> ballot</strong>s were posted into a slot in the top of the local church altar instead. They may have been rough, but the cowboys wouldn&#039;t fight in the church.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3">thegeezer3</a>] 12-6-2007(14): Clint eastwood and alter. Here clint eastwood imposes law and order. Teh first thing he does is to hold a vote &quot;But we dont have a<strong> ballot</strong> box&quot;. clint punches a hole in the altar and says &quot; you do now!&quot; (imagine him standing over the altar and punching down kinda like karata guy would).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 23-4-2010(12): Even in the <em>Old West</em>, the<strong> ballot</strong>s <em>showed</em> Obama winning.
