1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/richcoop">richcoop</a>] 28-6-2012(209): The schools that accepted them were posted on a TREE, the students MINGLED around trying to find their names. (コオ）.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/JetSetArnett">JetSetArnett</a>] 12-3-2009(136): Note: this Kanji does <em>not</em> mean<strong> exam</strong>. It means school. I find this keyword an choice odd as <strong>school</strong> by itself is not used elsewhere.<strong> Exam</strong>ples: 校長 is principal (lit. school chief); 中学校 is junior high school (lit. middle study/knowledge school).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 31-12-2007(63): Ninja school<strong> exam</strong>: <em>Mingle</em> with the <em>trees</em>. If the teacher can spot you, you fail.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akahige">akahige</a>] 14-4-2009(40): Note: this Kanji does <em>not</em> mean<strong> exam</strong>. It means school. I find this keyword an choice odd as <strong>school</strong> by itself is not used elsewhere.<strong> Exam</strong>ples: 校長 is principal (lit. school chief); 中学校 is junior high school (lit. middle study/knowledge school). To add to JetSetArnett&#039;s: at the <em>school</em>, the <strong>trees</strong> outside are a popular place for the students to <strong>mingle</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cornrow">cornrow</a>] 5-12-2008(37): I &quot;<em>WOOD MINGLE</em>&quot;, but I have an<strong> exam</strong>. Ha ha ha.
