1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/calittle">calittle</a>] 2-10-2007(424): Every major political<strong> party</strong>, if personified, would look like a giant <em>outhouse</em> walking around with <em> human legs</em> spewing out a constant stream of bullshit.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 4-9-2007(50): Every political<strong> party</strong> is full of shit. But nobody ever says how they get that way. Well, here&#039;s your answer - a political<strong> party</strong> memer is in the outhouse, greedily chowing down on the contents inside. He&#039;s grown so accustomed to the taste that he&#039;s in all the way, and all you can see are his legs through the window. He&#039;ll come inside later to the auditorium to make a speech and spew everything out.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 1-11-2007(39): Here&#039;s an easy one from current events. Recently a certain senator, member of a family-values political<strong> party</strong>, was caught in an <em>outhouse</em> touching the <em>human legs</em> of the guy in the stall next to him - who happened to be a police officer. True story, folks - search for &quot;wide stance senator&quot; for details.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ctraabe">ctraabe</a>] 25-3-2008(12): Politicians in the (insert<strong> party</strong> name here)<strong> party</strong> deliver so much bullcrap, they might as well be outhouses on legs.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pacersfan218">pacersfan218</a>] 1-9-2007(10): Since he refused to become a member of the Chinese Communist<strong> Party</strong>, he was shoved into the outhouse with only his legs sticking out.
