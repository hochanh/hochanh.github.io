1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 24-9-2007(245): Features like <em>stones</em> and <em>groves of trees</em> are the<strong> cornerstone</strong>s of a happy <em>zoo</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 9-11-2007(60): A zoo which is still under construction is already full of animals. At the moment, only the<strong> cornerstone</strong> has been set in place. To temporarily keep the animals from escaping, a closely-packed grove of small trees is planted around the stone. (Note that this zoo needs some serious <em>mending</em>.).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cerulean">cerulean</a>] 4-7-2008(39): <em>Stone Grove Zoo</em> is the new<strong> cornerstone</strong> in animal exhibits! If you love animals you need to check out <em>Stone Grove Zoo!</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jshield1">jshield1</a>] 23-4-2009(29): How am I the only one who doesn&#039;t see how mend turned into zoo with one stroke.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 17-12-2007(15): To make room for the new <em>zoo</em>, they use dynamite sending all the <em>grove&#039;s</em> trees flying in the air. That big <em>stone</em> on the left now serves as<strong> cornerstone</strong>. (Variation on ziggr&#039;s story, with more emphasis on placement that was giving me trouble).
