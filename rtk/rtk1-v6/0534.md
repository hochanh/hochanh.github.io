1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/GenPDP7">GenPDP7</a>] 20-12-2007(234): When you<strong> call on</strong> someone, you point your words in their direction.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 22-3-2007(71): Japanese streets usually don&#039;t have names, so finding places can be difficult. So if you plan to<strong> call on</strong> someone you need two things; 1) <em>words</em> (for asking the way) and 2) a <em>compass</em> (in case you get really lost).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 18-12-2006(52): When <strong>calling on</strong> a girl, you&#039;d better what what sweet <em>words</em> will turn her fancy in your <em>direction</em>. (Image: last century teenagers on a frilly couch in the sitting room, she with her back to him, and he fumbling for the right words to turn her around).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 26-1-2008(25): For this key word &#039;<strong> CALL ON</strong> &#039; and the more useful meaning of &#039;<strong>visit</strong>&#039;, think of: a booty call! Haven&#039;t you ever got a late night call from someone (on their <em>mobile</em>), asking for <em>words</em> of <em>direction</em> to your place? Quick, get out your Marvin Gaye record...

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/noname">noname</a>] 21-7-2008(23): Note: this kanzi means more like &quot;visit&quot; 訪ねる 【たずねる】 (v1,vt) to visit; (P). Thus, you VISIT another country that uses different WORDS than yours (language) and you have to find your way around with a COMPASS since you can&#039;t ask anyone for directions or read any signs.
