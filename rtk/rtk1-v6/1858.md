1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 1-10-2007(152): <em>Mr. T</em> is a harsh <em>taskmaster</em> who will<strong> discipline</strong> you (beat you into <em>shape</em>) with his <em>walking stick</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 29-1-2008(30): Note : the meaning is in the positive sense, to cultivate one&#039;s character or interests. To work to make yourself or something better.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Istvan">Istvan</a>] 2-8-2007(24): You may not have known it, but Mr. T is into discispline. Not just self<strong> discipline</strong>, in order to get into shape, but what he really likes is when the Task master spanks him with her walking stick. Don&#039;t tell Mr. T I told you. I pity da fool, and da fool would be me!!!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 5-2-2008(17): Compare with <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/958">permanence/remote</a> (#958 悠). <em>Mr. T</em> went to visit his old <em>taskmaster</em> who had a <em>walking stick</em>. Halfway on the way to that remote region, <em>Mr. T</em> was about to give up because of the long and difficult journey when he ran into <em>Bruce Lee</em>, who told him that<strong> discipline</strong> is needed to reach your goal.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 13-2-2009(13): <em>Mr. T</em> joins the X-men. When they catch <em>mystique</em>, he beats her with a <em>walking stick</em> like a true <em>taskmaster</em> to<strong> discipline</strong> her. But it turns out mystique has taken the shape of the walking stick, and she then beats him.
