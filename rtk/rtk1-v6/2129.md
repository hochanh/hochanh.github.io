1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/onsen_monkey">onsen_monkey</a>] 14-9-2006(149): Notice how BUGS BUNNY&#039;s legs (hint about stroke extension) are starting to get big MUSCLES? It must be because he&#039;s always EXERTING himself on the run from Elmer Fudd (or from kicking the shit out of Elmer Fudd when he catches up!!).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 8-2-2008(89): Hint: Energizer bunny.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raseru">raseru</a>] 16-6-2008(38): The energizer bunny&#039;s<strong> exertion</strong> of power keeps going and going...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 12-4-2007(12): <em>Bugs Bunny</em> spares himself the <strong>exertion</strong> of <em>muscle</em> power. Instead, he <strong>studies</strong> and tricks Fudd every time.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax">Zarxrax</a>] 21-6-2008(10): The <em>trix rabbit&#039;s</em> latest scheme to get the trix: Dress up with fake <em>muscles</em> like a body builder and amaze the kids as he lifts dumbbells. He accidentally uses real dumbbells though, and despite all his<strong> exertion</strong>, the kids discover his disguise. Geez, he really <strong>exerts</strong> himself in all these weird schemes... you&#039;d think it would just be easier to go to the store and buy a box.
